<h2>The Haunting of Low Fennel</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s</span> Low Fennel,&rdquo; said Major Dale.</p>

<p>We pulled up short on the brow of the
hill. Before me lay a little valley carpeted with
heather, purple slopes hemming it in. A group of
four tall firs guarded the house, which was couched
in the hollow of the dip&mdash;a low, rambling building,
in parts showing evidence of great age and in
other parts of the modern improver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the new wing,&rdquo; continued the Major,
raising his stick; &ldquo;projecting out this way.
It&rsquo;s the only addition I&rsquo;ve made to the house,
which, as it stood, had insufficient accommodation
for the servants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a quaint old place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is, and I&rsquo;m loath to part with it, especially
as it means a big loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Have you formed any theories since
wiring me?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatever. I&rsquo;ve always been a sceptic,
Addison, but if Low Fennel is not haunted, I&rsquo;m a
Dutchman, by the Lord Harry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed reassuringly, and the two of us
descended the slope to the white gate giving access
to a trim gravel path flanked by standard roses.
Mrs. Dale greeted us at the door. She was, as I
had heard, much younger than the Major, and a
distinctly pretty woman. In so far Dame Rumour
was confirmed; other things I had heard of her,
but I was not yet in a position to pass judgment.</p>

<p>She greeted me cordially enough, although
women are usually natural actresses. I thought
that she did not suspect the real object of my
visit. Tea was served in a delightful little drawing-room
which bore evidence of having but recently
left the hands of London decorators, but when
presently I found myself alone with my host in the
Major&rsquo;s peculiar sanctum, the real business afoot
monopolised our conversation.</p>

<p>The room which Major Dale had appropriated
as a study was on the ground floor of the new
wing&mdash;the wing which he himself had had built
on to Low Fennel. In regard to its outlook it was
a charming apartment enough, with roses growing
right up to the open window, so that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
perfume filled the place, and beyond, a prospect
of purple heather slopes and fir-clad hills.</p>

<p>Sporting prints decorated the walls, and the
library was entirely, or almost entirely, made up
of works on riding, hunting, shooting, racing, and
golf, with a sprinkling of Whyte-Melville and
Nat Gould novels and a Murray handbook or two.
It was a most cosy room, probably because it was so
untidy, or, as Mrs. Dale phrased it, &ldquo;so manny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On a side table was ranked enough liquid refreshment
to have inebriated a regiment, and, in one
corner, cigar-boxes and tobacco-tins were stacked
from the floor some two feet up against the wall.
We were soon comfortably ensconced, then, the
Major on a hard leather couch, and I in a deep
saddle-bag chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awkward sort of thing to explain,&rdquo;
began Dale, puffing away at a cigar and staring
through the open window; &ldquo;because, if you&rsquo;re
to do anything, you will want full particulars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Major continued, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve heard
how that blackguard Ellis let me down over those
shares? The result?&mdash;I had to sell the Hall&mdash;Fennel
Hall, where a Dale has been since the time
of Elizabeth! But still, never mind! that&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
not the story. This place, Low Fennel, is really
part of the estate, and I have leased it from
Meyers, who has bought the Hall. It was
formerly the home farm, but since my father&rsquo;s
time it has not been used for that purpose. The
New Farm is over the brow of the hill there, on the
other side of the high road; my father built it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;&mdash;Dale shifted uneasily and a look of
perplexity crossed his jolly, red face&mdash;&ldquo;there
were stories&mdash;uncomfortable stories. To cut a
long story short, Seager&mdash;a man named Seager,
who occupied it at the time I was at Sandhurst&mdash;was
found dead here, or something; I never was
clear as to the particulars, but there was an
inquiry and a lot of fuss, and, in short, no one
would occupy the property. Therefore the governor
built the New Farm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Low Fennel has been empty for many years
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; only for one. Ord, the head gardener
at the Hall, lived here up till last September.
The old story about Seager was dying out, you
see; but Ord must have got to hear about it&mdash;or
I&rsquo;ve always supposed so. At any rate, in September&mdash;a
dam&rsquo; hot September, too, almost if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
quite as hot as this&mdash;Ord declined to live here
any longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He told me a cock-and-bull story about his
wife having seen a horrible-looking man with a
contorted face peering in at her bedroom window!
I questioned the woman, of course, and she
swore to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He mopped his heated brow excitedly, and
burnt several matches before he succeeded in relighting
his cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She tried to make me believe that she woke
up and saw this apparition, but I bullied the truth
out of her, and, as I expected, the man Ord had
come home the worse for drink. I made up my
mind that the contorted face was the face of her
drunken husband&mdash;whom she had declined to
admit, and who therefore had climbed the ivy
to get in at the open window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She denied this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she denied it; they both did; but,
from evidence obtained at the <i>Three Keys</i> in the
village, I proved that Ord had returned home
drunk that night. Still&rdquo;&mdash;he shrugged his shoulders
ponderously&mdash;&ldquo;the people declined to remain
in the place, so what could I do? Ord was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
good gardener, and his drunken habits in no way
interfered with his efficiency. He gained nothing
out of the matter except that, instead of keeping
Low Fennel, a fine house, I sent him to live in
one of the Valley Cottages. He lives there now,
for he&rsquo;s still head gardener at the Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made an entry in my notebook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must see Ord,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should,&rdquo; agreed the Major in his loud voice;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll get nothing out of him. He&rsquo;s the most
pig-headed liar in the county! But to continue.
The place proved unlettable. All the old stories
were revived, and I&rsquo;m told that people cheerfully
went two miles out of their way in order to avoid
passing Low Fennel at night! When I sold the
Hall and decided to lease the place from the
new proprietor, believe me it was almost hidden
in a wilderness of weeds and bushes which had
grown up around it. By the Lord Harry, I don&rsquo;t
think a living soul had approached within a
hundred yards of the house since the day that the
Ords quitted it! But it suited my purpose,
being inexpensive to keep up; and by adding this
new wing I was enabled to accommodate such
servants as we required. The horses and the
car had to go, of course, and with them a lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
my old people, but we brought the housekeeper
and three servants, and when a London firm had
rebuilt, renovated, decorated, and so forth, it
began to look habitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a charming place,&rdquo; I said with sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it!&rdquo; snapped the Major, tossing his half-smoked
cigar on to a side table and selecting a
fresh one from a large box at his elbow. &ldquo;Help
yourself, the bottle&rsquo;s near you. Is it!...
Hullo! what have we here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He broke off, cigar in hand, as the sound of
footsteps upon the gravel path immediately outside
the window became audible. Through the
cluster of roses peered a handsome face, that of
a dark man, whose soft-grey hat and loose tie
lent him a sort of artistic appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, Wales!&rdquo; cried the Major, but
without cordiality. &ldquo;See you in half an hour or
so; little bit of business in hand at the moment,
Marjorie&rsquo;s somewhere about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; called the new arrival, and, waving
his hand, passed on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s young Aubrey Wales,&rdquo; explained Dale,
almost savagely biting the end from his cigar,
&ldquo;son of Sir Frederick Wales, and one of my
neighbours. He often drops in.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Mentally considering the Major&rsquo;s attitude, certain
rumours which had reached me, and the youth
and beauty of Mrs. Dale, I concluded that the
visits of Aubrey Wales were not too welcome to
my old friend. But he resumed in a louder voice
than ever:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was last night that the fun began. I can
make neither head nor tail of it. If the blessed
place is haunted, why have we seen nothing of the
ghost during the two months or so we have lived
at Low Fennel? The fact remains that nothing
unusual happened until last night. It came
about owing to the infernal heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Alson, the housekeeper, came down about
two o&rsquo;clock, intending, so I understand, to get a
glass of cider from the barrel in the cellar. She
could not sleep owing to the heat, and felt extremely
thirsty. There&rsquo;s a queer sort of bend in
the stair&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you in a minute; and as she
came down and reached this bend she met a man,
or a thing, who was going up! The moonlight
was streaming in through the window right upon
that corner of the stair, and the apparition stood
fully revealed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I gather that it was that of an almost naked
man. Mrs. Alson naturally is rather reticent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the point, but I gather that the apparition was
inadequately clothed. Regarding the face of the
thing she supplies more details. Addison&rdquo;&mdash;the
Major leant forward across the table&mdash;&ldquo;it was the
face of a demon, a contorted devilish face, the
eyes crossed, and glaring like the eyes of a mad
dog!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course the poor woman fainted dead away
on the spot. She might have died there if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for the amazing heat of the night.
This certainly was the cause of her trouble, but
it also saved her. About three o&rsquo;clock I woke up
in a perfect bath of perspiration. I never remember
such a night, not even in India, and, as Mrs.
Alson had done an hour earlier, I also started to
find a drink. Addison! I nearly fell over her as
she lay swooning on the stair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He helped himself to a liberal tot of whisky, then
squirted soda into the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For once in a way I did the right thing,
Addison. Not wishing to alarm Marjorie, I
knocked up one of the maids, and when Mrs.
Alson had somewhat recovered, gave her into the
girl&rsquo;s charge. I sat downstairs here in this room
until she could see me, and then got the particulars
which I&rsquo;ve given you. I wired you as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
as the office was open; for I said to myself,
&lsquo;Dale, the devilry has begun again. If Marjorie
gets to hear of it there&rsquo;ll be hell to pay. She
won&rsquo;t live in the place.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood up abruptly, as a ripple of laughter
reached us from the garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we explore the scene of the trouble?&rdquo;
he suggested, moving toward the door.</p>

<p>I thought in the circumstance our inspection
might be a hurried one; therefore:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you mind very much if I sought it out
for myself?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It is my custom in cases
of the kind to be alone if possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, certainly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My ramble concluded, I will rejoin Mrs. Dale
and yourself&mdash;say on the lawn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo; cried the Major, throwing open
the door. &ldquo;An opening has been made on the floor
above corresponding with this, and communicating
with the old stair. Go where you like; find out
what you can; but remember&mdash;not a word to
Marjorie.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Filled with the liveliest curiosity, I set out to
explore Low Fennel. First I directed my attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to the exterior, commencing my investigations
from the front. That part of the building
on either side of the door was evidently of Tudor
date, with a Jacobean wing to the west containing
apartments overlooking the lawn&mdash;the latter a
Georgian addition; whilst the new east wing,
built by Major Dale, carried the building out
almost level with the clump of fir-trees, and into
the very heart of the ferns and bushes which here
grew densely.</p>

<p>There was no way around on this side, and not
desiring to cross the lawn at present, I passed in
through the house to the garden at the back. This
led me through the northern part of the building
and the servants&rsquo; quarters, which appeared to be of
even greater age than the front of the house. The
fine old kitchen in particular was suggestive of the
days when roasting was done upon a grand scale.</p>

<p>Beyond the flower garden lay the kitchen
garden, and beyond that the orchard. The latter
showed evidences of neglect, bearing out the
Major&rsquo;s story that the place had been unoccupied
for twelve months; but it was evident, nevertheless,
that the soil had been cultivated for many
generations. Thus far I had discovered nothing
calculated to assist me in my peculiar investigation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and entering the house I began a room-to-room
quest, which, beyond confirming most of my
earlier impressions, afforded little data.</p>

<p>The tortuous stairway, which had been the scene
of the event described by my host, occupied me
for some time, and I carefully examined the
time-blackened panels, and tested each separate
stair, for in houses like Low Fennel secret passages
and &ldquo;priest-holes&rdquo; were to be looked for. However,
I discovered nothing, but descending again
to the hall I made a small discovery.</p>

<p>There were rooms in Low Fennel which one
entered by descending or ascending two or three
steps, but this was entirely characteristic of the
architectural methods of the period represented.
I was surprised, however, to find that one mounted
three steps in order to obtain access to the passage
leading to the new wing. I had overlooked this
peculiarity hitherto, but now it struck me as
worthy of attention. Why should a modern
architect introduce such a device? It could
only mean that the ground was higher on the east
side of the building, and that, for some reason,
it had proved more convenient to adopt the
existing foundations than to level the site.</p>

<p>I returned to the hall-way and stood there deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in thought, when the contact of a rough tongue
with my hand drew my attention to a young
Airedale terrier who was anxious to make my
acquaintance. I patted his head encouragingly,
and, having reviewed the notes made during my
tour of inspection, determined to repeat the tour
in order to check them.</p>

<p>The Airedale accompanied me, behaving himself
with admirable propriety as we passed around
the house and then out through the kitchens into
the garden. It was not until my journey led me
back to the three steps, communicating with the
new wing, that my companion seemed disposed to
desert me.</p>

<p>At first I ascribed his attitude to mere canine
caprice. But when he persistently refused to be
encouraged, I began to ascribe it to something else.</p>

<p>Suddenly grasping him by the collar, I dragged
him up the steps, along the corridor, and into the
Major&rsquo;s study. The result was extraordinary.
I think I have never seen a dog in quite the same
condition; he whimpered and whined most
piteously. At the door he struggled furiously, and
even tried to snap at my hand. Then, as I still kept
a firm grip upon him, he set out upon a series of
howls which must have been audible for miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
around. Finally I released him, having first
closed the study door, and lowered the window.
What followed was really amazing.</p>

<p>The Airedale hurled himself upon the closed
door, scratching at it furiously, with intermittent
howling; then, crouching down, he turned his
eyes upon me with a look in them, not savage, but
truly piteous. Seeing that I did not move, the dog
began to whimper again; when, suddenly making
up his mind, as it seemed, he bounded across
the room and went crashing through the glass of
the closed window into the rose bushes, leaving me
standing looking after him in blank wonderment.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Aubrey Wales stayed to dinner, and since he
had no opportunity of dressing, his presence
afforded a welcome excuse for the other members
of the party. The night was appallingly hot;
the temperature being such as to preclude the
slightest exertion. The Major was an excellent
host, but I could see that the presence of the
younger man irritated him, and at times the conversation
grew strained; there was an uncomfortable
tension. So that altogether I was not
sorry when Mrs. Dale left the table and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
quartet was broken up. On closer acquaintance
I perceived that Wales was even younger than I
had supposed, and therefore I was the more
inclined to condone his infatuation for the society
of Mrs. Dale, although I felt less sympathetically
disposed toward her for offering him the encouragement
which rather openly she did.</p>

<p>Ere long, Wales left Major Dale and myself for
the more congenial society of the hostess; so that
shortly afterwards, when the Major, who took at
least as much wine as was good for him, began
to doze in his chair, I found myself left to my own
devices. I quitted the room quietly, without disturbing
my host, and strolled around on to the
lawn smoking a cigarette, and turning over in my
mind the matters responsible for my presence at
Low Fennel.</p>

<p>With no definite object in view, I had wandered
towards the orchard, when I became aware of a
whispered conversation taking place somewhere
near me, punctuated with little peals of laughter.
I detected the words &ldquo;Aubrey&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marjorie&rdquo;
(Mrs. Dale&rsquo;s name), and, impatiently tossing my
cigarette away, I returned to the house, intent
upon arousing the Major and terminating this
tête-à-tête. That it was more, on Mrs. Dale&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
part, than a harmless flirtation, I did not believe;
but young Wales was not a safe type of man for
that sort of amusement.</p>

<p>The Major, sunk deep in his favourite chair in
the study, was snoring loudly, and as I stood
contemplating him in the dusk, I changed my
mind, and retracing my steps, joined the two in
the orchard, proclaiming my arrival by humming
a popular melody.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he fallen asleep?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dale,
turning laughing eyes upon me.</p>

<p>I studied the piquant face ere replying. Her
tone and her expression had reassured me, if further
assurance were necessary, that my old friend&rsquo;s
heart was in safe keeping; but she was young
and gay; it was a case for diplomatic handling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;India leaves its mark on all men,&rdquo; I replied
lightly; &ldquo;but I have no doubt that the Major is
wide-awake enough now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My words were an invitation; to which, I was
glad to note, she responded readily enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s come and dig him out of that cavern of
his!&rdquo; she said, and linking her right arm in that
of Wales, and her left with mine, she turned us
about toward the house.</p>

<p>Dusk was now fallen, and lights shone out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
several windows of Low Fennel. Suddenly, an
upper window became illuminated, and Mrs. Dale
pointed to this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my room,&rdquo; she said to me; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it
delightfully situated? The view from the window
is glorious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I consider Low Fennel charming in every way,&rdquo;
I replied.</p>

<p>Clearly she knew nothing of the place&rsquo;s sinister
reputation, which seemed to indicate that she
employed herself little with the domestic side of
the household; otherwise she must undoubtedly
have learnt of the episode of the man with the
contorted face, if not from the housekeeper,
from the maid. It was a tribute to the reticence
of the servants that the story had spread no
further; but the broken study window and the
sadly damaged Airedale already afforded matter
for whispered debate among them, as I had noted
with displeasure.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;digging out&rdquo; of the Major did not prove
to be an entire success. He was in one of his
peculiar moods, which I knew of old, and rather
surly, being pointedly rude on more than one
occasion to Wales. He had some accounts to
look into, or professed to have, and the three of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
presently left him alone. It was now about ten
o&rsquo;clock, and Aubrey Wales made his departure,
shaking me warmly by the hand and expressing
the hope that we should see more of one another.
He could not foresee that the wish was to be
realised in a curious fashion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dale informed me that the Major in all
probability would remain immured in his study
until a late hour, which I took to be an intimation
that she wished to retire. I therefore pleaded
weariness as a result of my journey, and went up
to my room, although I had no intention of
turning-in. I opened the two windows widely,
and the heavy perfume of some kind of tobacco
plant growing in the beds below grew almost
oppressive. The heat of the night was truly
phenomenal; I might have been, not in an English
home county, but in the Soudan. An absolute
stillness reigned throughout Low Fennel, and,
my hearing being peculiarly acute, I could detect
the chirping of the bats which flitted restlessly
past my windows.</p>

<p>It was difficult to decide how to act. My
experience of so-called supernatural appearances
had strengthened my faith in the theory set forth
in the paper &ldquo;Chemistry of Psychic Phenomena&rdquo;&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had attracted unexpected attention a
year before. Therein I classified hauntings under
several heads, basing my conclusions upon the
fact that such apparitions are invariably localised;
often being confined, not merely to a particular
room, for instance, but to a certain wall, door,
or window. I had been privileged to visit most
of the famous haunted homes of Great Britain,
and this paper was the result; but in the case of
Low Fennel I found myself nonplussed, largely
owing to lack of data. I hoped on the morrow
to make certain inquiries along lines suggested
by oddities in the structure of the house itself and
by the nature of the little valley in which it stood.</p>

<p>When meditating I never sit still, and whilst
marshalling my ideas I paced the room from end
to end, smoking the whole time. Both windows
and also the door, were widely opened. The
amazing heat-wave which we were then experiencing
promised to afford me a valuable clue,
for I had proved to my own satisfaction that the
apparitions variously known as &ldquo;controls&rdquo; and
&ldquo;elementals,&rdquo; not infrequently coincided with
abrupt climatic changes, thunder-storms, or heat
waves, or with natural phenomena, such as landslides
and the like.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>This pacing led me from end to end of the room,
then, between the open door and the large dressing-table
facing it. It was as I returned from the door
towards the dressing-table that I became aware
of the presence of the <em>contorted face</em>.</p>

<p>My peculiar studies had brought me into contact
with many horrible apparitions, and if familiarity
had failed to breed contempt, at least it had
served to train my nerves for the reception of
such sudden and ghastly appearances. I should
be avoiding the truth, however, if I claimed to
have been unmoved by the vision which now
met me in the mirror. I drew up short, with
one sibilant breath, and then stood transfixed.</p>

<p>Before me was a reflection of the open door,
and of part of the landing and stairs beyond it.
The landing lights were extinguished, and therefore
the place beyond the door lay in comparative
darkness. But, crawling in, serpent-fashion, inch
by inch, silently, intently, so that the head,
throat, and hands were actually across the threshold,
came a creature which seemed to be entirely
naked! It had the form of a man, but the face,
the dreadful face which was being pushed forward
slowly across the carpet with head held sideways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
so that one ear all but touched the floor, was
the face, not of a man, but of a ghoul!</p>

<p>I clenched my teeth hard, staring into the mirror
and trying to force myself to turn and confront,
not the reflection, but the reality. Yet for many
seconds I was unable to accomplish this. The
baleful, protruding eyes glared straight into
mine from the glass. The chin and lower lip
of this awful face seemed to be drawn up so as
almost to meet the nose, entirely covering the
upper lip, and the nostrils were distended to an
incredible degree, whilst the skin had a sort of
purple tinge unlike anything I had seen before.
The effect was grotesque in the true sense of the
word; for the thing was clearly grimacing at
me, yet God knows there was nothing humorous
in that grimace!</p>

<p>Nearer it came and nearer. I could hear the
heavy body being drawn across the floor; I could
hear the beating of my own heart ... and I could
hear a whispered conversation which seemed to
be taking place somewhere immediately outside
my room.</p>

<p>At the moment that I detected the latter
sound, it seemed that the apparition detected
it also. The protruding eyes twisted in the head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
rolling around ridiculously but horribly. Despite
the dread which held me, I identified the whisperers
and located their situation. Mrs. Dale
was at her open window and Aubrey Wales was
in the garden below.</p>

<p>The thought crossed my mind and was gone&mdash;but
gone no quicker than the contorted face.
By a sort of backward, serpentine movement,
the thing which had been crawling into my room
suddenly retired and was swallowed up in the
shadows of the landing.</p>

<p>I turned and sprang toward the open door, the
fever of research hot upon me, and my nerves
in hand again. At the door I paused and listened
intently. No sound came to guide me from the
darkened stair, and when, stepping quietly
forward and leaning over the rail, I peered down
into the hall below, nothing stirred, no shadow
of the many there moved to tell of the passage
of any living thing. I paused irresolute, unable
to doubt that I was in the presence of an authentic
apparition. But how to classify it?</p>

<p>Slowly I returned to my room, and stood there,
thinking hard, and all the while listening for the
slightest sound from within or without the house.</p>

<p>The whispered conversation continued, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
I stole quietly to one of the windows and leant
out, looking to the left, in the direction of the
new wing. A light burnt in the Major&rsquo;s study,
whereby I concluded that he was still engaged
with his accounts, if he had not fallen asleep.
Between my window and the new wing, and on
a level with my eyes, was the window of Mrs.
Dale&rsquo;s room; and in the bright moonlight I could
see her leaning out, her elbows on the ledge. Her
bare arms gleamed like marble in the cold light,
and she looked statuesquely beautiful. Wales I
could not see, for a thick, square-clipped hedge obstructed
my view ... but I saw something else.</p>

<p>Lizard fashion, a hideous unclad shape crawled
past beneath me amongst the tangle of ivy and
low plants about the foot of the fir trees. The
moonlight touched it for a moment, and then it
was gone into denser shadows....</p>

<p>A consciousness of impending disaster came to
me, but, because of its very vagueness, found me
unprepared. Then suddenly I saw young Wales.
He sprang into view above the hedge, against
which, I presume, he had been crouching; he leapt
high in the air as though from some menace on
the ground beneath him. I have never heard a
more horrifying scream than that which he uttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Marjorie! Marjorie!&rdquo;
and yet again: &ldquo;Marjorie! <em>save me!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he was down, still screaming horribly,
and calling on the woman for aid&mdash;as though she
could have aided him. The crawling thing made
no sound, but the dreadful screams of Wales
sank slowly into a sort of sobbing, and then into a
significant panting which told of his dire extremity.</p>

<p>I raced out of the room, and down the dark
stair into the hall. Everywhere I was met by
locked doors which baffled me. I had hoped
to reach the garden by way of the kitchens, but
now I changed my plan and turned my attention
to the front-door. It was bolted, but I drew the
bolts one after the other, and got the door open.</p>

<p>Outside, the landscape was bathed in glorious
moonlight, and a sort of grey mist hovered over
the valley like smoke. I ran around the angle
of the house on to the lawn, and went plunging
through flower-beds heedlessly to the scene of
the incredible conflict.</p>

<p>I almost fell over Wales as he lay inert upon the
gravel path. The shadows veiled him so that
I could not see his face; but when, groping with
my hands, I sought to learn if his heart still
pulsed, I failed to discover any evidence that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
did. With my hand thrust against his breast and
my ear lowered anxiously, I listened, but he gave
no sign of life, lying as still as all else around
me.</p>

<p>Now this stillness was broken. Excited voices
became audible, and doors were being unlocked
here and there. First of all the household, Mrs.
Dale appeared, enveloped in a lace dressing-gown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aubrey!&rdquo; she cried tremulously, &ldquo;what
is it? where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is here, Mrs. Dale,&rdquo; I answered, standing
up, &ldquo;and in a bad way, I fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, what has happened to
him? Did you hear his awful cries?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; I said shortly.</p>

<p>Standing with the moonlight fully upon her,
Mrs. Dale sought him in the shadows of the hedge&mdash;and
I knew that by the manner of his frightened
outcry the man lying unconscious at my feet had
forfeited whatever of her regard he had enjoyed.
She was dreadfully alarmed, not so much on his
behalf, as by the mystery of the attack upon him.
But now she composed herself, though not without
visible effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he, Mr. Addison?&rdquo; she said firmly,
&ldquo;and what has happened to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>A man, who proved to be a gardener, now
appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help me to carry him in,&rdquo; I said to this new
arrival; &ldquo;perhaps he has only fainted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We gathered up the recumbent body and carried
it through the kitchens into the breakfast-room,
where there was a deep couch. All the servants
were gathered at the foot of the stairs, frightened
and useless, but the outcry did not seem to have
aroused Major Dale.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dale and I bent over Wales. His face
was frightfully congested, whilst his tongue
protruded hideously; and it was evident, from
the great discoloured weals which now were
coming up upon his throat, that he had been
strangled, or nearly so. I glanced at the white face
of my hostess and then bent over the victim, examining
him more carefully. I stood upright again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know first aid, Mrs. Dale?&rdquo; I asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>She nodded, her eyes fixed intently upon me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then help to employ artificial respiration,&rdquo;
I said, &ldquo;and let one of the girls get ammonia,
if you have any, and a bowl of hot water. We
can patch him up, I think, without medical aid&mdash;which
might be undesirable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Dale seemed fully to appreciate the point,
and in business-like fashion set to work to assist
me. Wales had just opened his eyes and begun
to clutch at his agonized throat, when I heard a
heavy step descending from the new wing&mdash;and
Major Dale, in his dressing-gown, joined us.
His red face was more red than usual, and his
eyes were round with wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s everybody up for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There has been an accident, Major,&rdquo; I said,
glancing around at the servants, who stood in a
group by the door of the breakfast-room; &ldquo;I
can explain more fully later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Dale stepped forward and looked down
at Wales.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s young
Wales, by the Lord Harry!&mdash;what&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dale, standing just behind me, laid her
hand upon my arm; and, unseen by the Major,
I turned and pressed it reassuringly.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The following day I lunched alone with the
Major, Mrs. Dale being absent on a visit. It
had been impossible to keep the truth from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
(or what we knew of it) and at present I could
not quite foresee the issue of last night&rsquo;s affair.
Young Wales, who had been driven home in a
car sent from his place at a late hour, had not
since put in an appearance; and it was sufficiently
evident that Mrs. Dale would not welcome him
should he do so, the hysterical panic which he had
exhibited on the previous night having disgusted
her. She had not said so in as many words, but
I did not doubt it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Addison?&rdquo; said the Major as I entered,
&ldquo;have you got the facts you were looking for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of them,&rdquo; I replied, and opening my
notebook I turned to the pages containing
notes made that morning.</p>

<p>The Major watched me with intense curiosity,
and almost impatiently awaited my next words.
The servant having left the room:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; I began, glancing at the
notes, &ldquo;I have been consulting certain local
records in the town, and I find that in the year
1646 a certain Dame Pryce occupied a cabin
which, according to one record, &lsquo;stood close
beside unto ye Lowe Fennel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is, close beside this house?&rdquo; interjected
the Major excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;She attracted the attention
of one of the many infamous wretches who
disfigure the history of that period: Matthew
Hopkins, the self-styled Witch-Finder General.
This was a witch-ridden age, and the man Hopkins
was one of those who fattened on the credulity
of his fellows, receiving a fee of twenty shillings
for every unhappy woman discovered and convicted
of witchcraft. Poor Pryce was &lsquo;swum&rsquo;
in a local pond (a test whereby the villain Hopkins
professed to discover if the woman were one of
Satan&rsquo;s band, or otherwise) and burnt alive in
Reigate market-place on September 23, 1646.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By God!&rdquo; said the Major, who had not
attempted to commence his lunch, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a
horrible story!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is one of the many to the credit of Matthew
Hopkins,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;but, without boring you
with the details of this woman&rsquo;s examination
and so forth, I may say that what interests me
most in the case is the date&mdash;September 23.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? I don&rsquo;t follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a hiatus in the history
of the place after that, except that even in those
early days it evidently suffered from the reputation
of being haunted; but without troubling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
about the interval, consider the case of Seager,
which you yourself related to me. Was it not
in the month of August that he was done to death
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Gad!&rdquo; cried the Major, his face growing
redder than ever, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right!&mdash;and hang it all,
Addison! it was in September&mdash;last September&mdash;that
the Ords cleared out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember your mentioning,&rdquo; I continued,
smiling at his excitement, &ldquo;that it was a very
hot month?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From a mere word dropped by one of the
witnesses at the trial of poor Pryce I have gathered
that the month in which she was convicted of
practising witchcraft in her cabin adjoining Low
Fennel (as it stood in those days) was a tropically
hot month also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Dale stared at me uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of my depth, Addison&mdash;wading
hopelessly. What the devil has the heat to do
with the haunting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To my mind everything. I may be wrong,
but I think that if the glass were to fall to-night,
there would be no repetition of the trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean that it&rsquo;s only in very hot
weather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In phenomenally hot weather, Major&mdash;the
sort that we only get in England perhaps once
in every ten years. For the glass to reach the
altitude at which it stands at present, in two
successive summers, is quite phenomenal, as you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s phenomenal for it to reach that point
at all,&rdquo; said the Major, mopping his perspiring
forehead; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simply Indian, simply Indian,
sir, by the Lord Harry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another inquiry,&rdquo; I continued, turning over
a leaf of my book, &ldquo;I have been unable to complete,
since, in order to interview the people who
built your new wing, I should have to run up
to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the blazes have they to do with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, but I should have liked to
learn their reasons for raising the wing three feet
above the level of the hall-way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between the heat and his growing excitement,
Major Dale found himself at a temporary loss
for words. Then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told me,&rdquo; he shouted at the top of
his voice, &ldquo;they told me at the time that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
something about&mdash;that it was due to the plan&mdash;that
it was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can imagine that they had some ready
explanation,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but it may not have been
the true one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what the&mdash;what the&mdash;is the true
one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The true one is that the new wing covers a
former mound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right; it does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my theory is correct, it was upon this
mound that the cabin of Dame Pryce formerly
stood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite possible; they used to allow dirty
hovels to be erected alongside one&rsquo;s very walls
in those days&mdash;quite possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moreover, from what I&rsquo;ve learnt from Ord&mdash;whom
I interviewed at the Hall&mdash;and from
such accounts as are obtainable of the death of
Seager, this mound, and not the interior of Low
Fennel as it then stood, was the scene of the
apparitions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me out of my depth again,
Addison. What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seager was strangled outside the house,
not inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; agreed the Major,
still shouting at the top of his voice, but gradually
growing hoarser; &ldquo;I remember they found
him lying on the step, or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then again, the apparition with the contorted
face which peered in at Mrs. Ord&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lies, all lies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you, Major. She was
trying to shield her husband, but I think she
saw the contorted face right enough. At any
rate it&rsquo;s interesting to note that the visitant
came from outside the house again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; cried the Major, banging his fist upon
the table, &ldquo;it wanders about inside the house, and&mdash;and&mdash;damn
it all!&mdash;it goes outside as well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where it goes,&rdquo; I interrupted quietly, &ldquo;is
not the point. The point is, where it comes
from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where do you believe it comes from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe the trouble arises, in the strictest
sense of the word, from the same spot whence it
arose in the days of Matthew Hopkins, and from
which it had probably arisen ages before Low
Fennel was built.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it to arise from the ancient barrow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
or tumulus, above which you have had your
new wing erected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Dale fell back in his chair, temporarily
speechless, but breathing noisily; then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tumulus!&rdquo; he said hoarsely; &ldquo;d&rsquo;you mean
to tell me the house is built on a dam&rsquo; burial
ground?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the whole house,&rdquo; I corrected him;
&ldquo;only the new wing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then is the place haunted by the spirit of
some uneasy Ancient Briton or something of
that sort, Addison? Hang it all! you can&rsquo;t
tell me a fairy tale like that! A ghost going
back to pre-Roman days is a bit too ancient for
me, my boy&mdash;too hoary, by the Lord Harry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have said nothing about an Ancient British
ghost&mdash;you&rsquo;re flying off at a tangent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all, Addison! I don&rsquo;t know what
you&rsquo;re talking about at all, but nevertheless
your hints are sufficiently unpleasant. A tumulus!
No man likes to know he&rsquo;s sleeping in a
graveyard, not even if it is two or three thousand
years old. D&rsquo;you think the chap who surveyed
the ground for me knew of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the fact that he planned the new wing
so as to avoid excavation, I think probably he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
did. He was wise enough to surmise that the
order might be cancelled altogether and the
job lost if you learnt the history of the mound
adjoining your walls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A barrow under the study floor!&rdquo; groaned
the Major&mdash;&ldquo;damn it all! I&rsquo;ll have the place
pulled down&mdash;I won&rsquo;t live in it. Gad! if Marjorie
knew, she would never close her eyes
under the roof of Low Fennel again&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure
she wouldn&rsquo;t, I know she wouldn&rsquo;t. But
what&rsquo;s more, Addison, the thing, whatever it is,
is dangerous&mdash;infernally dangerous. It nearly
killed young Wales!&rdquo; he added, with a complacency
which was significant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the fright that nearly killed him,&rdquo; I
said shortly.</p>

<p>Major Dale stared across the table at me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Addison,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what
does it mean? What unholy thing haunts Low
Fennel? You&rsquo;ve studied these beastly subjects,
and I rely upon you to make the place clean and
good to live in again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I doubt if Low Fennel
will ever be fit to live in. At any time an abnormal
rise of temperature might produce the
most dreadful results.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you care to have the new wing pulled down
and the wall bricked up again, if you care to
keep all your doors and windows fastened securely
whenever the thermometer begins to
exhibit signs of rising, if you avoid going out on
hot nights after dusk, as you would avoid the
plague&mdash;yes, it may be possible to live in Low
Fennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the Major became speechless, but finally:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean, Addison?&rdquo; he whispered;
&ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake, tell me. What is it?&mdash;what
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what some students have labelled an
&lsquo;elemental&rsquo; and some a &lsquo;control,&rsquo;&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;it is something older than the house, older,
perhaps, than the very hills, something which
may never be classified, something as old as the
root of all evil, and it dwells in the Ancient British
tumulus.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>As I had hoped, for my plans were dependent
upon it, the mercury towered steadily throughout
that day, and showed no signs of falling at night;
the phenomenal heat-wave continued uninterruptedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The household was late retiring, for
the grey lord&mdash;Fear&mdash;had imposed his will upon
all within it. Every shadow in the rambling
old building became a cavern of horrors, every
sound that disturbed the ancient timbers a portent
and a warning.</p>

<p>That the servants proposed to leave <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>
at the earliest possible moment was perfectly
evident to me; in a word, all the dark old stories
which had grown up around Low Fennel were
revived and garnished, and new ones added to
them. The horror of the night before had left
its mark upon every one, and the coming of dusk
brought with it such a dread as could almost
be felt in the very atmosphere of the place.
Ghostly figures seemed to stir the hangings,
ghostly sighs to sound from every nook of the old
hall and stairway; baleful eyes looked in at
the open windows, and the shrubberies were
peopled with hosts of nameless things who whispered
together in evil counsel.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dale was as loath to retire as were the
servants, more especially since the Major and I
were unable to disguise from her our intention
of watching for the strange visitant that night.
But finally we prevailed upon her to depart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and she ran upstairs as though the legions of the
lost pursued her, slamming and locking her door
so that the sound echoed all over the house.</p>

<p>We had told her nothing, of course, of my discoveries
and theories, but nevertheless the cat
was out of the bag; the affair of the night before
had spoilt our scheme of secrecy.</p>

<p>In the Major&rsquo;s study we made our preparations.
The windows were widely opened, and the door
was ajar. Not a breath of wind disturbed the
stillness of the night, and although Major Dale
had agreed to act exactly as I might direct, he
stared in almost comic surprise when he learnt
the nature of these directions.</p>

<p>Placing two large silk handkerchiefs upon the
table, I saturated them with the contents of a
bottle which I had brought in my pocket, and
handed one of the handkerchiefs to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tie that over your mouth and nostrils,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;and whatever happens don&rsquo;t remove it
unless I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Addison....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the compact, Major? If you
aren&rsquo;t prepared to assist I must ask you to retire.
To-night might be the last chance, perhaps, for
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Growling beneath his breath, Major Dale
obeyed, and, a humorous figure enough, stretched
himself upon the couch, staring at me round-eyed.
I also fastened a handkerchief about my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would perhaps be better,&rdquo; I said, my voice
dimmed by the wet silk, &ldquo;if we avoided conversation
as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing up, I rolled back a corner of the carpet,
exposing the floor-planks, and with a brace-and-bit,
which I had in my pocket, I bored a round
hole in one of these. Into it I screwed the tube,
attached to a little watch-like contrivance,
twisting the face of the dial so that I could study
it from where I proposed to sit. Then I took up
my post, smothering a laugh as I noted the expression
upon that part of the Major&rsquo;s red face
which was visible to me.</p>

<p>Thus began the business of that strange night.
Half an hour passed in almost complete silence,
save for the audible breathing of the Major&mdash;by
no means an ideal companion for such an
investigation. But, having agreed to assist
me, in justice to my old friend I must say that
he did his best to stick to the bargain, and to play
his part in what obviously he regarded as an
insane comedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>At about the expiration of this thirty minutes,
I thought I heard a door open somewhere in the
house. Listening intently, and glancing at my
companion, I received no confirmation of the
idea. Evidently the Major had heard nothing.
Again I thought I heard a sound&mdash;as of the
rustling of silk upon the stair, or in an upper
corridor; finally I was almost certain that the
floor of the room above (viz. the Major&rsquo;s bedroom)
creaked very slightly.</p>

<p>At that I saw my companion glance upward,
then across at me, with a question in his eyes.
But not desiring to disturb the silence, I merely
shook my head.</p>

<p>An hour passed. There had been no repetition
of the slight sounds to which I have referred,
and the stillness of Low Fennel was really extraordinary.
A thermometer, which I had placed
upon the table near to my elbow, recorded the
fact that the temperature of the room had not
abated a fraction of a point since sunset, and,
sitting still though I was, I found myself bathed
in perspiration. Despite the open door and
windows, not a breath of air stirred in the place,
but the room was laden with the oppressive
perfume of those night-scented flowers which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
have mentioned elsewhere, for it was faintly
perceptible to me, despite the wet silk.</p>

<p>Once, a bat flew half in at one of the windows,
striking its wings upon the glass, but almost
immediately it flew out again. A big moth
fluttered around the room, persistently banging
its wings against the lamp-shade. But nothing
else within or without the house stirred, if I
except the occasional restless movements of the
Major.</p>

<p>Then all at once&mdash;and not gradually as I
had anticipated&mdash;the meter at my feet began to
register. Instantly, I looked to the thermometer.
It had begun to fall.</p>

<p>I glanced across at Major Dale. He was staring
at something which seemed to have attracted
his attention in a distant corner of the room.
Glancing away from the meter, the indicator
of which was still moving upward, I looked in the
same direction. There was much shadow there,
but nevertheless I could not doubt that a very
faint vapour was forming in that corner ...
rising&mdash;rising&mdash;rising&mdash;slowly higher and higher.</p>

<p>It proceeded from some part of the floor
concealed by the big saddle-bag chair&mdash;the
Major&rsquo;s favourite dozing-place (probably from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a faulty floor-board), and it was rising visibly,
inch upon inch, as I watched, until it touched
the ceiling above. Then, like a column of smoke,
it spread out, mushroom fashion; it crept in
ghostly coils along the cornices, spreading,
a dim grey haze, until it obscured a great part
of the ceiling.</p>

<p>Again I looked across at the Major. He was
staring at the phenomenon with eyes which were
glassy with amazement. I could see that momentarily
he expected the vapour to take shape,
to form into some ghoulish thing with a contorted
face and clutching, outstretched fingers.</p>

<p>But this did not happen. The vapour, which
was growing more fine and imperceptible, began
to disperse. I glanced from corner to corner
of the room, then down to the meter on the
floor. The indicator was falling again.</p>

<p>Still I made no move, although I could hear
Major Dale fidgeting nervously, but I looked
across at him ... and a dreadful change had
come over his face.</p>

<p>He was sitting upright upon the couch, the
edge of which he clutched with one hand, whilst
with the other he combed the air in a gesture
evidently meant to attract my attention. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
was trying to speak, but only a guttural sound
issued from his throat. His staring eyes were
set in a glare of stark horror upon the door
of the study.</p>

<p>Swiftly I turned&mdash;to see the door slowly opening;
to see, low down upon the bare floor&mdash;for
I had removed the carpet from that corner of
the room&mdash;a ghastly, contorted face, held sideways
with one ear almost touching the ground,
and with the lower lip and the chin drawn up
as though they were of rubber, almost to the tip
of the nose!</p>

<p>The eyes glared up balefully into mine, the hair
hung a dishevelled mass about the face, and I
had a glimpse of one bare shoulder pressed upon
the floor.</p>

<p>Wider and wider opened the door; and further
into the room crept the horrible apparition....</p>

<p>The light gleamed equally upon the hideous,
contorted face and upon the rounded shoulders
and slim, white arms, on one of which a heavy
gold Oriental bangle was clasped.</p>

<p>It was a woman!</p>

<p>In a flash of inspiration&mdash;at sight of the bangle&mdash;my
doubts were resolved; <em>I understood</em>.
Leaning across the table, I extinguished the lamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
... in the same instant that Major Dale, uttering
an inarticulate, choking cry, sprang to his feet
and toppled forward, senseless, upon the floor!</p>

<p>The study became plunged in darkness, but
into the long corridor, beyond the open door,
poured the cold illumination of the moon.
Framed in the portal, uprose a slim figure, seeming
like a black silhouette upon a silvern background,
or a wondrous statue in ebony. Elfin, dishevelled
locks crowned the head; the pose of the form
was as that of a startled dryad or a young Bacchante
poised for a joyous leap....</p>

<p>Thus, for an instant, like some exquisite dream
of Phidias visualised, the figure stood ... then
had fled away down the corridor and was gone!</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Close upon a month had elapsed. Major Dale
and I sat in my study in London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young Aubrey Wales has gone abroad,&rdquo;
I said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ashamed to show up again, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; growled the Major&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing
to crow about, myself, by the Lord Harry!
There&rsquo;s courage and courage, sir! I&rsquo;ve led more
than one bayonet attack, but I&rsquo;d never qualify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
for the D.S.O. as a ghost-hunter!&mdash;never, by
Gad!&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached out for the decanter; then withdrew
his hand. &ldquo;Doctor&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Discipline must be maintained!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the sudden excitement which precipitated
the seizure,&rdquo; I said, glancing at the altered
face of my old friend. &ldquo;I was wrong to expose
you to it; but of course I did not know that the
doctor had warned you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the Major, sighing loudly
as he filled his tumbler with plain soda-water&mdash;&ldquo;what
have you to tell me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place&mdash;have you definitely decided
to leave Low Fennel, for good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;not a doubt on the point! We&rsquo;re
leasing a flat in town here whilst we look around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Because I very much doubt if the
place could ever be rendered tenable....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s really haunted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By what, Addison? Tell me that!&mdash;by
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By a grey vapour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Dale&rsquo;s eyes began to protrude, and:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Addison,&rdquo; he said hoarsely&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t joke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
about it!&mdash;don&rsquo;t joke. It was not a grey vapour
that strangled Seager....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly it was not. Seager was strangled
by some wholly inoffensive person&mdash;we shall
probably never know his identity&mdash;who had
fallen asleep amongst the bushes on the mound,
close beside the house....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But man alive! I&rsquo;ve <em>seen</em> the beastly thing,
with my own eyes! You&rsquo;ve seen it! Wales saw
it! Mrs. Ord saw it!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ord saw her husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;re coming round to my belief about
the Ords!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Decidedly I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what did Wales see&mdash;eh? And what
did <em>I</em> see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw the vapour in operation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Major fell back in his chair with an expression
upon his face which I cannot hope to
describe. Words failed him altogether.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had come prepared for something of the
sort,&rdquo; I continued rapidly; &ldquo;for I have investigated
several cases of haunting&mdash;notably in the
Peak district&mdash;which have proved to be due to an
emanation from the soil&mdash;a vapour. But the
effect of such vapour, in the other cases, was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
induce delusions of sight, in nearly every instance
(although, in two, the delusions were of hearing).</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other words, the person affected by this
vapour was drugged, and, during the drugged
state, perceived certain visions. I made the
mistake, at first, of supposing that Low Fennel
came within the same category. The classical
analogy, of course, is that of the Sibyls, who
delivered the oracular responses from the tripod,
under the afflatus of a vapour said to arise from
the sacred subterranean stream called Kassotis.
The theory is, therefore, by no means a new one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Dale stared dully, but made no attempt
to interrupt me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are probably many spots, in England
alone,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;thus affected; but,
fortunately, few of them have been chosen as
building-sites. Barrows and tumuli of the stone
and bronze age, and also Roman shrines, seem
frequently to be productive of such emanations.
The barrow beside Low Fennel (and now under the
new wing) is a case in point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sudden atmospheric changes seem to be
favourable to the formation of the vapour. The
barrow in Peel Castle, Isle of Man, is peculiarly
susceptible to thunder-storms, for instance, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that at Low Fennel emits a vapour only after
a spell of intense heat, and at the exact moment
when the temperature begins to fall again. In
the case of a sustained heat-wave, this would
take place at some time during each night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now for the particular in which the
vapour at Low Fennel differs from other, similar
emanations. It is not productive of delusions of
sight; it induces a definite and unvarying form
of transient insanity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Dale moved slightly, but still did not
speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dame Pryce was the first recorded victim of
the vapour. She was accused of witchcraft by
a neighbour who testified to having seen her transform
herself into a hideous and unrecognizable
hag&mdash;whereas, in her proper person, she seems
to have been a comely old lady. Lack of evidence
compels us to dismiss the case of Seager, but
consider that of the Ords. The man Ord, on
his own confession, had fallen asleep outside the
house. He became a victim of the vapour&mdash;and
his own wife failed to recognize him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what extent the mania so produced is
homicidal remains to be proved; the gas is rare
and difficult to procure, so that hitherto analysis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
has not been attempted. My own theory is
that the subject remains harmless provided that,
whilst under the mysterious influence, he does not
encounter any person distasteful to him. Thus,
Seager may have met his death at the hands of some
tramp who had been turned away from the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the symptoms: they seem to be quite
unvarying. The subject strips, contorts his face
out of all semblance to humanity (and always
in a particular fashion) and crawls, lizard-like
upon the ground, with the head held low, in an
attitude of listening. That it is possible so to
contort the face as to render it unrecognizable
is seen in some cases of angina pectoris, of course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The subject apparently returns to the spot
from whence he started and sinks into profound
sleep, as is seen in some cases of somnambulism;
and&mdash;like the somnambulist, again&mdash;he acquires
incredible agility. How you yourself came,
twice, under the influence of the vapour, is easily
explained. The first time&mdash;when the housekeeper
saw you&mdash;you had actually been in bed;
and the second time, as you have told me, you
had gone upstairs, undressed, and then slipped
on your dressing-gown in order to complete some
work in the study. Instead of completing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
work, you dozed in your chair&mdash;and we know
what followed! In the case of&mdash;Mrs. Dale....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God! Addison,&rdquo; said the Major huskily,
and stood up, clutching the chair-arms&mdash;&ldquo;Addison!
You are trying to tell me that&mdash;what I
saw was ... <em>Marjorie!</em>...&rdquo;</p>

<p>I nodded gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Without letting her suspect my reason for
making the inquiries, I learnt that on that last
night at Low Fennel, feeling dreadfully lonely
and frightened, she determined to run along to
the new wing&mdash;which seemed a safer place&mdash;and
to wait in your room until you came up. She
fell asleep, and....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Addison ... can a mere &lsquo;vapour&rsquo; produce
such....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean, is the vapour directed or animated,
by some discarnate, evil intelligence? My dear
Major, you are taking us back to the theory
of Elemental spirits, and I blankly refuse to
follow you!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Valley of the Just<br />

<span class="f8">A Story of the Shan Hills</span></h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">The</span> merciless sun beat down upon the little
caravan, winding its way upward and ever
upward to the hill-land. Beneath stretched a
panorama limned in feverish greens and unhealthy
yellows; scarlike rocks striated the jungle, clothing
the foothills, and through the dancing air,
viewed from the arid heights, they had the
appearance of running water. Swamps to the
south-east showed like unhealing wounds upon
the face of the landscape; beyond them spread
the muddy river waters, the bank of the stream
proper being discernible only by reason of a
greater greenness in the palm-tops: venomous
green slopes beyond them again, a fringe of
dwarfed forest, and the brazen skyline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>On the right of the path rose volcanic rock,
gnarled, twisted, and contorted as with the agonies
of some mighty plague, which in a forgotten past
had seized upon the very bowels of the world,
and had contorted whole mountains, and laid
waste vast forests and endless plains. Above,
the cruel sun; ahead, more plague-twisted rocks,
with sandy scars dancing like running water;
and, all around, the breathless stillness, the
swooning stillness of tropical midday. North,
south, east, and west, that haze of heat, that
silence unbroken, lay like an accursed mantle
upon Burma.</p>

<p>Moreen Fayne could scarcely support herself
upright in the saddle; her head throbbed incessantly,
and the veil which she wore could not
protect her eyes from the maddening glare of
the sun. But although at any moment during
the past hour she could have slipped insensible
from her saddle, she sat stiffly upright, her dauntless
eyes looking straight ahead, her small mouth
set with masculine sternness, and her hands
clenched&mdash;the physical reflection of the mental
effort whereby, alone, she was enabled to pursue
the journey.</p>

<p>Just in front of her paced Ramsa Lal. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
stride had not varied from the lowlands, through
the foothills, nor on the rocky mountain paths.
He had looked neither right nor left, but had
walked, walked, walked. At times Moreen had
been hard put to it to choke down the hysterical
screams which had risen in her throat; madness
had threatened her, as she watched, in dumb
misery, that silent striding man. Yet she knew
that it was only the presence of this tireless,
immobile guide which had enabled her to go on;
although he never directed one glance towards
her, she knew that his steady march was meant
for encouragement.</p>

<p>Behind, like the tail of a scorpion, trailed the
native retinue, and on the end of the tail, where
the sting would be, rode her husband. This
simile had occurred to her at once, and she
allowed her mind to dwell upon the idea as an
invalid will consider imaginary designs upon the
wall-paper of the sick-room.</p>

<p>Sometimes there was a sliding of hoofs and
a sound of stumbling; sometimes her own pony
lost his footing. On such occasion, there would
be mechanical cries of encouragement from the
natives, and perhaps a growling curse from the
man who brought up the rear of the little company.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
The road wound through a frowning
chasm, where lizards and other creeping things
darted into holes to right and left of their progress.
Grateful shadow ruled a while, and a stifled sigh
escaped from Moreen&rsquo;s lips. Ramsa Lal paced
straightly onward, the others came stumbling
behind; fifty yards ahead the ravine opened out,
and once more the deathly heat poured unchecked
upon their heads.</p>

<p>Again Moreen all but lost control of herself;
her fortitude threatened to slip from her; so
that she bit her lips until the pain filled her eyes
with burning tears. The effort to control herself
proved successful, but left her white and quivering.
She felt impelled to speak to Ramsa Lal,
and constrained herself only with a second effort
of which her will was barely capable. Then she
saw that speech, which would be dangerous, was
unnecessary; the man&rsquo;s wonderful intuition had
enabled him to hear that crying of the soul, and
he was answering her.</p>

<p>His brown fingers were clutching and unclutching
convulsively, and as he swung his arm, he
would clench his right fist and beat the air.
For a moment he acted thus, and then, as if he
knew that she had seen, and understood, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
fingers hung limply again, and his arm swung
loosely as before.</p>

<p>A sort of plateau was reached, and in a natural
clearing, where giant bamboos ranged back to
the tangled, creeper-laden boughs of the forest
trees, the voice of Major Fayne cried a halt.
Ramsa Lal was beside Moreen&rsquo;s pony in a trice,
and he so screened her exhausted descent from
the saddle, setting her down upon an hospitable
bank hard by, that she was enabled to maintain
her inflexible attitude, when presently her
husband came striding along to stand looking
down on her, where she sat. His blackly pencilled
brows were drawn together, and the pale blue
eyes shone out, saturnine, from cavernous sockets.
His handsome face was heavily lined, and in the
appearance, in the whole attitude of the man, was
something aggressive, a violence markedly repellent.
Moreen locked her hands behind her, the
fingers twining and intertwining, but she raised
a pale face to his, from which by a last supreme
effort of will she had driven all traces of emotion.</p>

<p>So they remained for a moment, whilst the
servants busied themselves with the baggage;
he, with feet wide apart, staring down at her, and
slashing at the air with a fly-whisk, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
meeting his gaze with a stony calm pitiful to
behold, had there been any soul capable of pity
to see her. Ramsa Lal was directing operations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said Major Fayne, &ldquo;we camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice would have told a skilled observer
that which the facial lines and a certain odd
puffiness of skin more than suggested, that Major
Fayne was not a temperate man.</p>

<p>Moreen made no sign, but simply sat watching
the speaker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a delightful situation,&rdquo; continued he,
&ldquo;and your ambition, frequently expressed in
Mandalay, to see something of Burma other than
bridge parties and polo-matches, at last is
realised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke with a seeming sincerity that had
carried conviction to any, save the most sceptical.
But Moreen made no sign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; continued Major Fayne, &ldquo;you may
feast your eyes upon the glories of a Burma
forest. Those flowering creepers yonder, festooned
from bough to bough, are peculiar to this
district, and if you care to explore further, you
will be rewarded by the discovery of some fine
orchids. Note, also, the perfume of the
flowers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>He twirled his slight moustache, and turned
away to supervise the work of camping.</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal already had one of the tents nearly
erected, and Moreen watched his deft fingers at
work, with an anxiety none the less because it
was masked. She knew that collapse was
imminent. The cruel march under the pitiless
sun had had due effect, but it had not broken her
spirit. She knew that she had reached the end
of her strength, but she showed no sign of weakness
before her husband.</p>

<p>It was done at last, and Ramsa Lal held the
tent-cloth aside, and bowed.</p>

<p>Moreen stood up, clenched her teeth together
grimly, and staggered forward. As the tent-flap
was dropped, she sank down beside the camp
bedstead, and her head fell upon the covering.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Dusk fell, a quick curtain, and the lamps of
night shone out with glorious brilliancy, illuminating
the little plateau. The tents gleamed whitely
in the cold radiance; there was a dancing redness
to show where the fire had been built, with
figures grouped dimly around it. On a jagged
rock, which started up from the very heart of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
thicket, black against the newly risen moon, was
silhouetted the figure of Major Fayne. Night
things swept the air about him, and rustled in
the cane brake below him; the fire crackled in
the neighbouring camp; sometimes a murmur
came from the group of natives.</p>

<p>But, heedless of these matters, Moreen&rsquo;s husband
stood on the rocky eminence looking back
upon the way they had come, looking down to the
distant river valley.</p>

<p>For many minutes he remained so, but presently,
clambering down, heavily forced his way
through the undergrowth to the little camp.
Passing the tents, he walked back to the dip of
the pathway, and paused again, watching and
listening; then turned and strode to the fire,
grasped Ramsa Lal by the shoulder, and drew
him away from the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; he directed tersely.</p>

<p>At the head of the pathway he bade him halt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he directed.</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal stood in an attitude of keen attention,
and the Major watched him with feverish
anxiety, which he was wholly unable to conceal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear it?&rdquo; he demanded&mdash;&ldquo;hoofs on
the path!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Ramsa Lal shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear nothing, Sahib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your ear to the ground, and listen. I
tell you that I saw figures moving away below
there, and I heard&mdash;hoofs, stumbling hoofs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man knelt down upon the ground, and,
bending forward, lowered his head. Major Fayne
watched him, and with growing anxiety, so that,
what with this and the pallid moonlight, his face
appeared ghastly.</p>

<p>But again Ramsa Lal stood up, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Sahib,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>Major Fayne suddenly grasped him by the
shoulders, spinning him about, and dragging him
forward, so that the dusky face was but inches
removed from his own. He glared into the man&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you lying to me?&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;are
you lying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear it is the truth: why should I lie to
you, Sahib?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Fayne broke off abruptly and thrust the
man away from him. A different expression had
crept into his face, an expression in which there
was something furtive. He spun around upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
his heel and stepped to the tent where Moreen
was. Raising the flap slightly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he called, and turned away.</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal had gone back to the fireside; and
Fayne, following a moment of hesitancy, strode
with his swaggering military gait to the tent
erected in the furthermost corner of the clearing.
He had stooped to enter, when he hesitated,
remaining there bent forward&mdash;and listening.</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the distant fire,
Ramsa Lal, though few would have suspected
the fact, was watching. Evidently enough, the
leader of the little company was obsessed with
his delusion that some one or something clambered
up the steep path beneath. Suddenly shrugging
his shoulders, he stooped yet lower, and dived
into the tent.</p>

<p>One of the natives threw fresh fuel upon the
fire, and a stream of sparks sped up through the
clear air in a widening trail ever growing fainter.</p>

<p>There was a crackling, a murmur of voices, and
then a new silence. This in turn was broken by
the distant howling of dogs, and in the near
stillness one might have heard the faint shrieking
of the bats, who now were embarked upon their
nocturnal voyagings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>A shrill, wild scream burst suddenly from the
heart of the trees in the east, rose eerily upon the
night, and died away. But the group about the
fire moved not at all, for this dreadful screaming
but marked an animal tragedy of the Burma
forests. So furred things howled and screamed
and moaned in the woodlands, feathered things
piped and hooted around and above, and the
bats, uncanny creatures of the darkness, who
seem to have kinship neither with fur nor feather,
chirped faintly overhead.</p>

<p>Once there was a distant, hollow booming like
the sound of artillery, which echoed down the
mountain gorges, and seemed to roll away over
the lowland swamps, and die, inaudible, by the
remote river-bank.</p>

<p>Yet no one stirred; for this mysterious gunnery
is a phenomenon met with in that district,
inexplicable, weird, but no novelty to one who
has camped in the Shan Hills.</p>

<p>A second time later in the night the phantom
guns boomed; and again their booming died
away in the far valleys. The fire was getting
low, now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Moreen lay, sleepless, wide-eyed, staring up at
the roof of the tent. She had eaten, could eat,
nothing, but she was consumed by a parching
thirst. The sounds of the night had no terrors
for her; indeed, she scarcely noticed them, for
she had other and more dreadful things to
think of.</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal had been her father&rsquo;s servant;
him she could trust. But the others&mdash;the others
were Major Fayne&rsquo;s. They were no more than
spies upon her; guards.</p>

<p>What did it mean, this sudden dash from the
bungalow into the hills? It amused her husband
to pretend that it was a pleasure-trip, but the
equipment was not of the sort one takes upon
such occasions, and one is not usually dragged
from bed at midnight to embark upon such a
journey. It was additionally improbable in view
of the fact that up to the moment of departure
Major Fayne had not spoken to her, except in
public, for six months. The dreadful, forced
marches were breaking her down, and she knew
that her husband was drinking heavily. What,
in God&rsquo;s name, would be the end of it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Weakly, she raised herself into a sitting position,
groping for and lighting a candle. From the
bosom of her dress she took out a letter, the last
she had received from home before this mad
flight. There was something in it which had
frightened her at the time, but which, viewed in
the light of recent events, was unspeakably
horrifying.</p>

<p>During the long estrangement between her
husband and herself she had learnt, and had paid
for her knowledge with bitter tears, that there
was a side to the character of Major Fayne which
he had carefully concealed from her before marriage;
the dark, saturnine part of her husband&rsquo;s
character had dawned upon her suddenly. That
had been the beginning of her disillusionment,
the disillusionment which has come to more than
one English girl during the first twelve months of
married life in an Indian bungalow.</p>

<p>Then, perforce, the gap had widened, and six
months later had become a chasm quite impassable
except in the interests of social propriety.
Anglo-Indian society is notable for divorces, and
poor Moreen very early in her married life fully
understood the reason.</p>

<p>She held the letter to the dim light and read it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
again attentively. Allowing a certain discount
for her mother&rsquo;s changeless animosity towards
Major Fayne, it yet remained a startling letter.
Much of it consisted in feckless condolences,
characteristic but foolish; the passage, however,
which she read and re-read by the dim, flickering
light was as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harringay in his last letter begged of me
to come out by the next boat to Rangoon,&rdquo; her
mother wrote. &ldquo;He has quite opened my eyes
to the truth, Moreen, not in such a way as to
shock me all at once, but gradually. I always
distrusted Ralph Fayne and never disguised the
fact from you. I knew that his previous life
had been far from irreproachable, but his treatment
of you surpasses even <em>my</em> expectations. I
know <em>all</em>, my poor darling! and I know something
which you do not know. His father did not die
in Colombo at all; he died in a madhouse! and
there are two other known dipsomaniacs in Ralph
Fayne&rsquo;s family&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hand reached over Moreen&rsquo;s shoulder and
tore the letter from her.</p>

<p>She turned with a cry&mdash;and looked up into her
husband&rsquo;s quivering face! For a moment he
stood over her, his left fist clenching and unclenching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and his pale blue eyes glassy with
anger. Then chokingly he spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you carry one of his letters about with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The veins were throbbing visibly upon his
temples. Moreen clutched at the blanket but
did not speak, dared not move, for if ever she had
looked into the face of a madman it was at this
moment when she looked into the face of Ralph
Fayne.</p>

<p>He suddenly grabbed the candle and, holding
it close to the letter, began to read. His hands
were perfectly steady, showing the tremendous
nerve tension under which he laboured. Then
his expression changed, but nothing of the maniac
glare left his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From your mother,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;and
full of two things&mdash;your wrongs, <em>your</em> wrongs!
and Jack Harringay&mdash;Jack Harringay&mdash;always
Jack Harringay! Damn him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put down the candle and began to tear the
letter into tiny fragments, pouring forth the
while a stream of coarse, blasphemous language.
Moreen, who felt that consciousness was slipping
from her, crouched there with a face deathly
pale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Fayne began to laugh softly as he threw the
torn-up letter from him piece by piece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn him!&rdquo; he said again. He turned the
blazing eyes towards his wife. &ldquo;You lying,
baby-faced hypocrite! Why don&rsquo;t you admit
that he is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped; the sinister laughter died upon
his lips and he stood there shaking all over and
with a sort of stark horror in his eyes dreadful to
see.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he muttered&mdash;and looked
at her almost pathetically,&mdash;&ldquo;why of course
you can&rsquo;t&mdash;no one can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reeled and clutched at the tent-flap, then
stumblingly made his way out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one can,&rdquo; came back in a shaky whisper&mdash;&ldquo;no
one can&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen heard him staggering away, until the
sound of his uncertain footsteps grew inaudible.
A distant howling rose upon the night, and,
nearer to the clearing, sounded a sort of tapping,
not unlike that of a woodpecker. Some winged
creature was fluttering over the tent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Dawn saw the dreadful march resumed. Major
Fayne now exhibited unmistakable traces of his
course of heavy drinking. He brought up the
rear as hitherto, and often tarried far behind
where some peculiar formation of the path enabled
him to study the country already traversed.
He had altered the route of the march, and now
they were leaving the Shan Hills upon the north-east
and dipping down to a chasm-like valley
through which ran a tributary of the Selween
River. Since the dry season was commenced
the entire country beneath them showed through
a haze of heat and dust.</p>

<p>They had partaken of a crude and hasty breakfast
as strangers having nothing in common
who by chance share a table. Moreen no longer
doubted that her husband was mad, for he muttered
to himself and was ever glancing over his
shoulder. This and his constant watching of the
path behind spoke of some secret terror from
which he fled.</p>

<p>Towards noon, they skirted a village whose
inhabitants poured forth <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en bloc</i> to watch the
passing of this unfamiliar company. A faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
hope that some European might be there died in
Moreen&rsquo;s breast. Her position was a dreadful
one. Led by a madman&mdash;of this she was persuaded&mdash;and
surrounded by natives who, if not
actively hostile, were certainly unfriendly, with
but one man to whom she could look for the
slightest aid, she was proceeding further and
further from civilisation into unknown wildernesses.</p>

<p>What her husband&rsquo;s purpose might be she
could not conceive. She was unable to think
calmly, unable to formulate any plan. In the
dull misery of a sick dream she rode forward
speculating upon the awakening.</p>

<p>The midday heat in the valley was so great
that a halt became imperative. They camped at
the edge of a dense jungle where banks of rotten
vegetation, sun-dried upon the top, lay heaped
about the bamboo stems. None but a madman
would have chosen to tarry in such a spot; and
Major Fayne&rsquo;s servants went about their work
with many a furtive glance at their master.
Ramsa Lal&rsquo;s velvety eyes showed a great compassion,
but Moreen offered no protest. She
was in an unreal frame of mind and her will was
merely capable of a mute indifference: any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
attempt to assert herself would have meant a
sudden breakdown. Something in her brain
was strained to utmost tension; any further
effort must have snapped it.</p>

<p>In the hour of the greatest heat Major Fayne
went out alone, offering no explanation of his
intentions and leaving no word as to the time of
his return. Moreen only learnt of his departure
from Ramsa Lal. She received the news with
indifference and asked no questions. Inert she
lay in the little tent looking out at the wall of
jungle, where it uprose but twenty yards away.
So the day wore on. Mechanically she partook
of food when Ramsa Lal placed it before her, but,
although the man&rsquo;s attitude palpably was one of
uneasiness, she did not question him, and he
departed in silence. It was an incredible situation.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon nothing occurred to
break this dread monotony save that once there
arose a buzz of conversation, and she became
dimly aware that some one from the native
village which they had passed in the morning
had come into the camp. After a time the
sounds had died away again, and Ramsa Lal had
stepped into view, looking towards her interrogatively;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
but although she recognized his wish
to speak to her, the inertia which now claimed
her mind and body prevailed, and she offered
him no encouragement to intrude upon her misery.</p>

<p>Thus the weary hours passed, until even to the
dulled perceptions of Moreen the sounds of
unrest and uneasiness pervading the camp began
to penetrate. Yet Major Fayne did not return.
The insect and reptile life of a Burmese jungle
moved around her, but she was curiously indifferent
to everything. Without alarm she brushed
a venomous spider, fully one inch in girth, from
the camp-bedstead, and dully watched it darting
away into the jungle undergrowth.</p>

<p>Darkness swept down and tropical night
things raised their mingled voices; then came
Ramsa Lal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Mem Sahib,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I
must speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She half reclined, looking at him as he stood, a
dimly seen figure, before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men from the village,&rdquo; continued he,
&ldquo;come to say that we may not camp. It is
holy ground from this place away&rdquo;&mdash;he waved
his arm vaguely&mdash;&ldquo;to the end of the jungle
where the river is.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do nothing, Ramsa Lal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear&mdash;for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major Fayne?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He goes into the jungle to look for something.
What does he go to look for? Why does he not
return?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen made no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All of them there&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated the direction
of the native servants&mdash;&ldquo;know this place. They
are already afraid, and, with those from the
village coming to warn us, they get more afraid
still. This is a haunted place, Mem Sahib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen sat up, shaking off something of the
lassitude which possessed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that jungle,&rdquo; replied Ramsa Lal, &ldquo;there
is buried a temple, a very old temple, and in the
temple there is buried one who was a holy man.
His spirit watches over this place, and none may
rest here because of him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the men of the village came here,&rdquo; said
Moreen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before sunset, Mem Sahib. No man would
come here after dark. Look! you will see&mdash;they
are frightened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Languidly, but with some awakening to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
necessities of the situation, Moreen stepped out
of the tent and looked across to where, about a
great fire, the retinue huddled in a circle. Ramsa
Lal stood beside her with something contemptuous
in the bearing of his tall figure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A spell lies upon all this valley, Mem Sahib,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Therefore it is called the Valley of the
Just.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because only the just can stay within its
bounds through the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen stared affrightedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that they die in the night,
Ramsa Lal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the night, Mem Sahib, before the dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By what means?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal spread his palms eloquently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It is a haunted
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid, for I have passed a night in
the Valley of the Just many years ago, and I
live.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With two others, Mem Sahib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;One was bitten by a snake an hour before
dawn, and the other, who was an upright man,
lives to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen shuddered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know&rdquo;&mdash;she still hesitated to broach
this subject with the man&mdash;&ldquo;do you know where&mdash;Major
Fayne has gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said, Mem Sahib, that a stream runs
through the jungle close beside the old temple,
a stream which bubbles up from a cavern and
which is supposed to come underground from the
Ruby Mine plateau. He goes early in the
morning to look for rubies&mdash;so I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen tapped the ground with her foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think&rdquo;&mdash;again she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;that
Major Fayne is afraid of something? Of something&mdash;where
we have come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal bowed low.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but we shall know
ere sunrise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Moreen scarcely grasped the
significance of his words; then their inner
meaning became apparent to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make me some coffee, Ramsa Lal,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;I am cold&mdash;very cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She re-entered the tent, lighting the lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The Valley of the Just! What irony, that her
husband should have selected that spot to camp
in! She sat deep in thought, when presently
Ramsa Lal entered with coffee. He had just
set down the tray when the sound of a distant cry
brought him rigidly upright. He stood listening
intently. The sound was repeated&mdash;nearer it
seemed&mdash;a sort of hoarse scream, terrible to
hear&mdash;impossible to describe.</p>

<p>Moreen rose to her feet and followed the man
out of the tent. Some one&mdash;some one who kept
crying out&mdash;was plunging heavily through the
jungle towards the camp.</p>

<p>The men about the fire were on their feet now.
Obviously they would have fled, but the prospect
of flight into the haunted darkness was one more
terrible than that of remaining where they were.</p>

<p>It ceased, that strange cry; but whoever was
approaching could be heard alternately groaning
and laughing madly.</p>

<p>Then out from the thicket on the west, into the
red light of the fire, burst a fearful figure. It was
that of Major Fayne, wild eyed, and with face
which seemed to be of a dull grey. He staggered
and almost fell, but kept on for a few more paces
and then collapsed in a heap almost at Moreen&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
feet, amid the clatter of the strange loot wherewith
he was laden.</p>

<p>This consisted in a number of golden vessels
heavily encrusted with gems, a huge golden
salver, and a dozen or more ropes of gigantic
rubies!</p>

<p>Amid these treasures, the ransom of a Sultan,
the price of a throne, he lay writhing convulsively.</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal was the first to recover himself.
He leapt forward, seized the prostrate man by
the shoulders and dragged him into the tent, past
Moreen. Having effected this he raised his eyes
in a mute question. She nodded, and whilst
Ramsa Lal seized the Major&rsquo;s shoulders, Moreen
grasped his ankles, and together they lifted him
up on to the bed.</p>

<p>He lay there, rolling from side to side. His
eyes were wide open, glassy and unseeing; a
slight froth was upon his lips, his fists rose and
fell in regular, mechanical beats, corresponding
with the convulsive movements of his knees.</p>

<p>Moreen dropped down beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ramsa Lal! Ramsa Lal! What shall I
do? What has happened to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal ripped the collar from Major<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Fayne&rsquo;s neck in order to aid his respiration.
Then, quietly signing to Moreen to hold the
lamp, he began to search the entire exposed
surface of the Major&rsquo;s skin. Evidently he failed
to find that for which he was looking. He
glanced down at the ankles, but the Major wore
thick putties and Ramsa Lal shook his head in a
puzzled way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is like the bite of a hamadryad,&rdquo; he said
softly, &ldquo;but there is no mark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do!&rdquo; moaned Moreen&mdash;&ldquo;what
shall I do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a frightened murmur from the
entrance, where the native servants stood in a
group, peering in. Moreen stood up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hot water, Ramsa Lal!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We
must give him brandy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it is useless, Mem Sahib; he has not
been bitten&mdash;there is no mark; it may be a fever
from the jungle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen beat her hands together helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must do <em>something</em>!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we
must do <em>something</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sudden change took place in Major Fayne.
The convulsive movements ceased and he lay
quiet, and breathing quite regularly. The glassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
look began to fade from his eyes, and with every
appearance of being in full possession of his
senses, he stared at Moreen and spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall repent of your words, Harringay,&rdquo;
he said in a quiet voice. &ldquo;You have deliberately
accused me of faking the cards. I care nothing
for any of you. Why should I attempt such a
thing? I could buy and sell you all!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen dropped slowly back upon her knees
again, white to the lips, watching her husband.
With the same appearance of perfect sanity,
but now addressing the empty air, he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my tent&mdash;my wife will tell you it is true&mdash;my
wife, Harringay, do you hear?&mdash;I have
jewelled cups and strings of rubies, enough to buy
up Mandalay! I blundered on to them in that
old ruined temple back in the jungle, not five
hundred yards from your bungalow. Harringay&mdash;think
of it&mdash;a treasure-room like that within
sight of your verandah! There are snakes
there, snakes, you understand, in hundreds;
but it is worth risking for a big fortune like
mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He mixes time and place,&rdquo; murmured Ramsa
Lal. &ldquo;He talks to the Commissioner Sahib in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Mandalay of what is here in the Valley of the
Just.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen nodded, catching her breath hysterically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued the delirious man, &ldquo;I
am as rich as Midas. Why should <em>I</em> want to
cheat you! Don&rsquo;t talk to me of what you would
do for my wife&rsquo;s sake! Keep your favours,
curse you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a contemptuous smile, Major Fayne
threw his head back upon the pallet. Then
came another change; the look of stark horror
which Moreen had seen once before crept into the
grey face; and her husband raised himself in
bed, glaring wildly into the shadows beyond the
lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a spirit!&rdquo; The words came in a
thrilling, eerie whisper. &ldquo;Oh God! I understand.
Yes! I came away from Harringay&rsquo;s
bungalow. My wife was asleep and I sat drinking
until I had emptied the whisky decanter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent forward as if listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I went back. I went back to reason
with him. No! as God is my witness I did not
plan it! I went back to reason with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the uncanny attitude was resumed.
Then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I stepped in through the verandah, and
there he sat with Moreen&rsquo;s photograph in his
hand. Listen to me&mdash;<em>Listen!</em>&rdquo; There was an
agony of entreaty in his voice; it rose to a thin
scream&mdash;&ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s photograph! Do you hear
me? Do you understand? <em>Moreen&rsquo;s</em> photograph&mdash;and
as I stood behind him, he raised it
to his lips&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Major Fayne stopped abruptly, as if checked
by a spoken word; and with wildly beating
heart Moreen found herself listening for the
phantom voice. She could hear the breathing
of the natives clustered behind her; but no
other sound save a distant howling in the jungle
was audible, until her husband began again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I struck him down&mdash;from behind, yes, from
behind. His blood poured over the picture.
You understand I was mad. If you are just&mdash;and
is not this called the Valley of the Just?&mdash;you
cannot condemn me. Why did I fly? I was
not in my right mind; I had&mdash;been drinking, as
I told you; I was mad. If I was not mad I
should never have fled, never have drawn suspicion&mdash;on
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He fell back as if exhausted, then once more
struggled upright and began to peer about him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
When he spoke again, his voice, though weak, was
more like his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moreen!&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;where the devil are
you? why can&rsquo;t you give me a drink?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, he seemed to perceive her, and he
drew his brows together in the old, ugly frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have found you
out! I am a rich man now, and when I have gone
to England, see what Jack Harringay will do for
you. I will paint London red! I have looted
the old temple, and they are after me, they&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words merged into a frightful scream.
Major Fayne threw up his hands and fell back
insensible upon the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mem Sahib! Mem Sahib, you must be
brave!&rdquo; It was Ramsa Lal who spoke; he
supported Moreen with his arm. &ldquo;There is a
spell upon this place. No medicine, nothing, can
save him. There is only one thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen controlled herself by one of those
giant efforts of which she was capable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she whispered&mdash;&ldquo;what must we
do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal removed his arm, saw that she
could stand unsupported, and bent forward over
the unconscious man. Following a rapid examination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
he signed to her to leave the tent. They
came out into the white blaze of the moonlight&mdash;and
there at their feet lay the glittering loot of
the haunted temple, a dazzlement of rainbow
sparks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only for such a thing as this,&rdquo; said Ramsa Lal,
&ldquo;dare I go, but not one of us will see another
dawn if we do not go.&rdquo; He pointed to the heap
of treasure. &ldquo;Mem Sahib must come also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;my husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must remain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is of his
own choosing.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The temple stood in a kind of clearing. Grotesquely
horrible figures guarded the time-worn
entrance. Moreen drew a deep breath of relief
on emerging from the jungle path by which, amid
the rustle of retreating snakes, they had come,
but shrank back affrighted from the blackness of
the ruined doorway. Ramsa Lal stood the
lantern upon the stump of a broken pillar, where
its faint yellow light was paled by the moon-rays.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is <em>you</em> who must restore,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>One by one he handed her the jewel-encrusted
vessels and hung the ropes of rubies upon her arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>She nodded, and as Ramsa Lal took up the
lantern and began to descend the steps within
followed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No foot save his,&rdquo; came back to her, &ldquo;has
trod these sacred steps for ages, for the secret of
the jungle path is known only to the few....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you&mdash;know the way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ramsa Lal did not reply.</p>

<p>They traversed a short tunnel; a heavy door
was thrust open; and Moreen found herself
standing in a small pillared hall. Through a
window high in one wall, overgrown with tangled
vegetation, crept a broken moonbeam. Directly
before her was the carven figure of a grotesque
deity. A long, heavily clamped chest stood
before it like an altar step.</p>

<p>She staggered forward, deposited her priceless
burden upon the floor, and mechanically began to
raise the lid of the chest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that one, Mem Sahib!&rdquo; The voice of
Ramsa Lal rose shrilly&mdash;&ldquo;not that one!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he spoke too late. Moreen realised that
there were three divisions in the chest, each
having a separate lid. As she raised the one in
the centre, a breath of fetid air greeted her
nostrils, and she had a vague impression that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
was no chest but the entrance to a deep pit.
Then all these thoughts were swept away by the
crowning horror which rose out of the subterranean
darkness.</p>

<p>A great winged creature, clammily white, rose
towards her, passed beneath her upraised hands
and sailed into the darkness on the right. She
heard it flapping its great bat wings against the
wall&mdash;heard them beating upon a pillar&mdash;then
saw it coming back towards her into the moonlight&mdash;and
knew no more.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Mem Sahib!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen opened her eyes. She lay, propped
against a saddle, at the camp beside the jungle.
She shuddered icily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ramsa Lal&mdash;how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I carried the Mem Sahib! the treasures of
the temple I restored to their resting-place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the&mdash;the other&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The door that the Mem Sahib opened she
opened by the decree of Fate. It was not for
Ramsa Lal to close it. That is a passage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;To the tomb of the great one who is buried
in the temple!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! heavens! that white thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
raised her hands to her face. &ldquo;But&mdash;the camp&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The camp is deserted! they all fled from&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen sat up, rigidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From something that came for what we
forgot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a ring upon his finger. I saw it,
and knew where it came from, but forgot to
remove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moreen stood up, and turned towards the
nearer tent. Ramsa Lal gently detained her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that way, Mem Sahib.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I must see him! I must, I <em>must</em> tell
him that he wrongs me, cruelly, wickedly!
You heard his words&mdash; Oh, God! can he have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be useless to tell him, Mem Sahib,&mdash;he
could not hear you! But that what you
would tell him is true I know well; for see&mdash;it
is the dawn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ramsa Lal!...&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The unjust cannot stay in this valley through
a night and live to see the dawn, Mem Sahib!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>At about that same hour, Deputy-Commissioner
Jack Harringay opened his eyes and
looked wonderingly at a grey-haired, white-aproned
nurse who sat watching him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak, Mr. Harringay,&rdquo; she said
soothingly. &ldquo;You have been very ill, but you
are on the high road to recovery now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nurse!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak; I know what you would
ask. There has been no scandal. The attack
upon you was ascribed to robbers. You have
been delirious, Mr. Harringay, and have told
me&mdash;many things. I am old enough, or nearly
old enough, to be your mother, so you will not
mind my telling you that a love like yours
deserves reward. God has spared your life;
be sure it was with a purpose&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Blue Monkey</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">A tropically</span> hot day had been followed
by a stuffy and oppressive evening. In
the tiny sitting-room of our tiny cottage, my
friend&mdash;who, for the purposes of this story, I
shall call Mr. East&mdash;by the light of a vapour
lamp was busily arranging a number of botanical
specimens collected that morning. His briar
fumed furiously between his teeth, and, his grim,
tanned face lowered over his work, he brought
to bear upon this self-imposed task all the intense
nervous energy which was his.</p>

<p>I sat by the open window alternately watching
my tireless companion and the wonderful and
almost eerie effects of the moonlight on the
heather. Then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We came here for quiet&mdash;and rest, East,&rdquo;
I said, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; snapped my friend. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it quiet
enough for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undeniably. But I don&rsquo;t remember to have
seen you rest from the moment that we left
London! I exclude your brief hours of slumber&mdash;during
which, by the way, you toss about and
mutter in a manner far from reposeful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No wonder. My nerves are anything but
settled yet, I grant you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, we had passed through a long and
trying ordeal, the particulars whereof have no
bearing upon the present matter, and in renting
this tiny and remote cottage we had sought
complete seclusion and forgetfulness of those
evil activities of man which had so long engaged
our attention. How ill we had chosen will now
appear.</p>

<p>I had turned again to the open window, when
my meditations were interrupted by a sound that
seemed to come from somewhere away behind
the cottage. Cigarette in hand, I leaned upon
the sill, listening, then turned and glanced toward
the littered table. East, his eyes steely
bright in the lamplight, was watching me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard it?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clearly. A woman&rsquo;s shriek!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tense, expectant, we sat listening for some
time, until I began to suspect that we had been
deceived by the note of some unfamiliar denizen
of the moors. Then, faintly, chokingly, the
sound was repeated, seemingly from much nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; snapped East.</p>

<p>Hatless, we both hurried around to the rear
of the cottage. As we came out upon the slope,
a figure appeared on the brow of a mound some
two hundred yards away and stood for a moment
silhouetted against the moonlit sky. It was
that of a woman. She raised her arms at sight
of us&mdash;and staggered forward.</p>

<p>Just in the nick of time we reached her, for
her strength was almost spent. East caught her
in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is Miss Baird!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What could it mean? The girl, who was near
to swooning and inarticulate with fatigue and
emotion, was the daughter of Sir Jeffrey Baird,
our neighbour, whose house, The Warrens, was
visible from where we stood.</p>

<p>East half led, half carried her down the slope
to the cottage; and there I gave her professional
attention, whilst, with horror-bright eyes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
parted lips, she fought for mastery of herself.
She was a rather pretty girl, but highly emotional,
and her pathetically weak mouth was doubtless
a maternal heritage, for her father, Sir Jeffrey,
had the mouth and jaw of the old fighter that he
was.</p>

<p>At last she achieved speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; she whispered brokenly; &ldquo;oh,
my poor father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; I began&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At Black Gap!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Gap!&rdquo; I said; for the place was close
upon half a mile away. &ldquo;Have you come so
far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is lying there! My poor father&mdash;dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried East, springing up&mdash;&ldquo;Sir
Jeffrey&mdash;dead? Not drowned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! he is lying on the path this side of
the Gap! I ... almost stumbled over ...
him. He has been ... murdered! Oh, God
help me!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>East and I stared at one another, speechless
with the sudden horror of it. Sir Jeffrey murdered!</p>

<p>Suddenly the distracted girl turned to my friend,
clutching frenziedly at his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. East!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what had my
poor father done to merit such an end? What
monster has struck him down? You will find him,
will you not? I thank God that you are here&mdash;for
although I know you as &lsquo;Mr. East,&rsquo; my father
confided the truth to me, and I am aware that
you are really a Secret Service agent, and I even
know some of the wonderful things you have done
in the past....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very indiscreet!&rdquo; muttered East, and his
jaws snapped together viciously. But&mdash;&ldquo;My
dear Miss Baird,&rdquo; he added immediately, in the
kindly way that was his own, &ldquo;rely upon me.
Myself and my fellow-worker, the doctor here,
had sought to escape from the darker things of
life, but it was willed otherwise. I esteemed
Sir Jeffrey very highly&rdquo;&mdash;his voice shook&mdash;&ldquo;very
highly indeed. I, too, thank God that I
am here.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Five minutes later, East and I set out across
the moor, leaving Miss Baird at the cottage.
By reason of the lonely situation, and the fact
that the nearest house, The Warrens, was fully
a mile and a half away, no other arrangement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was possible, since delay could not be entertained.</p>

<p>East had managed to glean some few important
facts. Sir Jeffrey, whose museum at The Warrens
was justly celebrated, had been to London
that day to attend an auction at Sotheby&rsquo;s.
His Greek secretary, Mr. Damopolon, and his
daughter had accompanied him. Returning by
train to Stanby, the nearest station, Miss Baird
had called upon friends in the village (Mr. Damopolon
had remained in London on business),
and Sir Jeffrey had set out in the dusk to walk the
two miles to The Warrens; for the car was undergoing
repairs.</p>

<p>Pursuing the same path later in the evening,
the girl had come upon the body of her father
in the dramatically dreadful manner already
related. He had no enemies, she declared, or
none known to her. She did not believe that
her father was carrying a large sum of money,
nor&mdash;although she had scarcely trusted herself to
look at him&mdash;did she believe that robbery had
been the motive of the crime.</p>

<p>Sir Jeffrey had been carrying a large parcel
containing one of his purchases, and I remembered,
as we silently pursued our way to the scene
of the murder, how East&rsquo;s keen eyes had seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to dance with excitement when Miss Baird, in
reply to a question, had told us what this parcel
contained. It was a large figure, in blue porcelain,
of a sacred ape, and was of Burmese or
Chinese origin; she was uncertain which.</p>

<p>Her father had apparently attached great
importance to this strange purchase, and had
elected to bear it home in person rather than to
trust it to railway transport.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you notice if this parcel was there,&rdquo;
East had inquired eagerly, &ldquo;when you discovered
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Baird had shaken her head in reply.</p>

<p>And now we were come to Black Gap, a weird
feature in a weird landscape. This was a great
hole in the moor, having high clay banks upon
one side descending sheer to the tarn, and upon
the other being flanked by low, marshy ground
about a small coppice. The road from Stanby
to The Warrens passed close by the coppice on
the south-east.</p>

<p>Regarding this place opinions differed. By
some it was supposed to be a natural formation,
but it was locally believed to mark the site of an
abandoned mine, possibly Roman. Its depth
was unknown, and the legend of the coach which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
lay at the bottom, and which could be seen under
certain favourable conditions, has found a place
in all the guide-books to that picturesque and
wild district.</p>

<p>Whatever its origin, Black Gap was a weird
and gloomy spot as one approached and saw
through the trees the gleam of the moonlight on
its mystic waters. And here, passing a slight
southerly bend in the track&mdash;for it was no more&mdash;we
came upon Sir Jeffrey.</p>

<p>He lay huddled in a grotesque and unnatural
attitude. His right hand was tightly clenched,
whilst with his left he clutched a tuft of rank
grass. Strangely enough, his soft hat was still
upon his head. His tweed suit, soft collar and,
tie all bore evidence of the fierce struggle which
the old baronet had put up for his life. A quantity
of torn brown paper lay scattered near the
body.</p>

<p>I dropped on my knees and made a rapid
examination, East directing the ray of a pocket-lamp
upon the poor victim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; rapped my friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was struck over the head by some heavy
weapon,&rdquo; I said slowly, &ldquo;and perhaps partly
stunned. His hat protected him to a degree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and he tackled his assailant. Death was actually
due, I should say, to strangulation. His throat
is very much bruised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>East made no reply. Glancing up from my
gruesome task, I observed that he was looking
at a faint track, which, commencing amid the
confused marks surrounding the body, led in
the direction of the coppice. East&rsquo;s steely eyes
were widely opened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name, what have we here!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>A kindred amazement to that which held East
claimed me, as I studied more closely the mysterious
tracks.</p>

<p>The spot where Sir Jeffrey had fallen was soft
ground, whereon the lightest footstep must have
left a clear impression. Indeed, around the recumbent
figure the ground showed a mass of
indistinguishable marks. But proceeding thence,
as I have said, in the direction of the neighbouring
coppice, was this faint trail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks,&rdquo; I said, in a voice hushed with something
very like awe, &ldquo;it looks like the track of
... <em>a child!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look again!&rdquo; snapped East.</p>

<p>I stooped over the first set of marks. Clearly
indented, I perceived the impressions of two small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
bare feet, and, eighteen or twenty inches ahead,
those of two small hands. I experienced a sudden
chill; my blood seemed momentarily to run
coldly in my veins, and I longed to depart from
the shadow of the trees, from the neighbourhood
of the Black Gap, and from the neighbourhood
of the man who had died there. For it seemed
to me that a barefooted infant had recently
crawled from the side of the dead man into the
coppice overhanging the tarn.</p>

<p>Looking up, I found East&rsquo;s steely eyes set upon
me strangely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you not miss something
that you anticipated finding?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hesitated, fearfully. Then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Jeffrey carries no cane,&rdquo; I began&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! I had failed to note that. Good!
But what else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Closely I surveyed the body, noting the disarranged
garments, the discoloured face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of this torn brown paper?&rdquo; snapped
my friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; I cried; and like a flash
my glance sought again those mysterious tracks&mdash;those
tracks of <em>something</em> that had crawled away
from the murdered man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo; inquired East deliberately, &ldquo;is the
Burmese porcelain ape of which we have heard?
And, since there are no tracks <em>approaching</em> the
body, where did the creature come from that
made those retiring from it, and ... what
manner of creature was it?&rdquo;</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>At East&rsquo;s request (for my friend was a man
of very great influence) the police, beyond the
unavoidable formalities, took no steps to apprehend
the murderer of Sir Jeffrey. East had
a long interview with the dead man&rsquo;s daughter,
and, shortly afterwards, went off to London,
leaving me to my own devices.</p>

<p>The subject of the strange death of the baronet
naturally engrossed my attention to the exclusion
of all else. Especially, my mind kept reverting
to the tracks which we had discovered leading
from the dead man&rsquo;s body into the coppice.
I scarcely dared to follow my ideas to what seemed
to be their logical conclusion.</p>

<p>That the track was that, not of a child, but of
an <em>ape</em>, I was now convinced. No such track
approached where the victim had lain; no track<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of any kind, other than that of his own heavy
footprints, led to the spot ... but the track of
an ape receded from it; and the baronet had
been carrying an ape (inanimate, certainly,
according to all known natural laws), which was
missing when his body was found!</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are the reflections of a madman!&rdquo;
I said aloud. &ldquo;Am I seriously considering the
possibility of a blue porcelain monkey having
come to life? If so, since no other footprints
have been discovered, I shall be compelled,
logically, to assume that the blue porcelain
monkey strangled Sir Jeffrey!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My friend, East, attached very great importance
to the missing curio; this he had not disguised
from me. But, beyond spending half an
hour or so among the trees of the coppice and
around the margin of the Black Gap, he had not
to my knowledge essayed any quest for it.</p>

<p>Finding my thoughts at once unpleasant and
unprofitable company, I suddenly determined to
make a call at The Warrens, in order to inquire
about the health of poor Miss Baird, and incidentally
to learn if there were any new development.</p>

<p>Off I set, and failed to repress a shudder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
despite the blazing sunlight, as I passed the gap
and the spot where we had found the dead man.
A tropical shower in the early morning had quite
obliterated the mysterious tracks. Coming to
The Warrens, I was shown into the fine old library.
That air of hush, so awesome and so significant,
prevailed throughout the house whose master
lay dead above, and when presently Mr. Damopolon
entered, attired in black, he seemed to
complete a picture already sombre.</p>

<p>As East and I had several times remarked, he
was a singularly handsome man, and moreover,
a very charming companion, widely travelled and
deeply versed in those subjects to which the late
baronet had devoted so many years of his life.
I had always liked Damopolon, though, as a rule,
I am distrustful of his race; and now, seeing at
a glance how hard the death of Sir Jeffrey had
hit him, I offered no unnecessary word of condolence,
but immediately turned the conversation
upon Miss Baird.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has but just hurried off to London, doctor,&rdquo;
he said, to my surprise. &ldquo;A telegram from
the solicitors rendered her immediate departure
unavoidable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has sustained this dreadful blow with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
exemplary fortitude,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Are you sure
she was strong enough for travel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I myself escorted her to the station; and
Mrs. Grierson, the late baronet&rsquo;s sister, has
accompanied her to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;whilst I remember&mdash;was
Sir Jeffrey carrying a cane at the time of
his death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had with him a heavy ash stick, as usual,
when we parted at Sotheby&rsquo;s, doctor; but, of
course, he may have left it there, as he had a
large parcel to take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that parcel! You can no doubt enlighten
me, Mr. Damopolon? What, roughly,
were the dimensions of this Burmese idol?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The monkey? I don&rsquo;t think it was actually
an idol, doctor; it was, rather, a grotesque
ornament. Oh, it was about the size of a small
Moorish ape, hollow, and weighing perhaps
six or seven pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it upon a pedestal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. It was completely modelled, even to
the soles of the feet and the nails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extraordinary!&rdquo; I muttered. &ldquo;Uncanny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some little while longer I remained, and then
set out, my doubts in no measure cleared up, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the cottage. To my surprise&mdash;for I had no idea
that I had tarried so long&mdash;dusk was come. I
will frankly confess it&mdash;I experienced a thrill of
supernatural dread at the thought that my path
led close beside Black Gap. However, it was a
glorious evening, and I should have plenty of
light for my return journey. I walked briskly
across the moorpath toward the scene of the
mysterious crime, hoping that I should find
East returned when I gained the cottage.</p>

<p>Perhaps in a wandering life I have known more
thrilling moments than some men; but never
while memory serves shall I forget that, when,
coming abreast of the coppice, and glancing
hurriedly into the shadow of the trees ... I saw
a crouching figure looking out at me!</p>

<p>Speech momentarily failed me; I stood rooted
to the spot. Then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, old man!&rdquo; I heard. &ldquo;Shall be
with you in a moment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was East!</p>

<p>Fear changed to the wildest astonishment.
Carrying a strange-looking bundle, he came out
and joined me on the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I frighten you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it necessary to ask!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;But&mdash;whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
were you doing there by the Black
Gap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fishing! Look what I have caught!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held up for my inspection the object which
he carried, by means of two loops of stout cord
bound about it. It was a large china figure of
an ape!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The blue monkey!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;Come!
I am going to The Warrens.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Again I sat in the fine old library of The Warrens.
At the further end of the long, book-laden
table, facing me, sat East; Mr. Damopolon
occupied a chair on the right, and midway
between us, in the centre of the table, presiding
over that strange meeting, was the fateful blue
monkey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Damopolon,&rdquo; said East, &ldquo;I
knew that Sir Jeffrey was carrying this thing&rdquo;&mdash;he
indicated the image&mdash;&ldquo;at the time of his
death, and, since it had disappeared, I assumed
at first that it had been the motive of the crime.
Sir Jeffrey had money and other valuables upon
him; therefore we were obviously dealing with
no ordinary thief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, I made inquiries respecting the
history of the thing, and found that it possessed
but little market value and next to no historical
importance. It was of comparatively modern
Chinese workmanship, and Sir Jeffrey had bought
it, apparently, because it amused him, though
why he should have taken the trouble to carry
it home, heaven only knows. My first idea&mdash;that
the curio was a very rare and costly piece&mdash;was
thus knocked on the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sought another motive for a crime so horrible
and, by a stroke of intuition, I found one. You
may not have had an opportunity of studying
the mysterious tracks which so puzzled us, Mr.
Damopolon, before they were obliterated, but
my friend, the doctor, will bear me out. They
commenced, then, close beside the body of the
murdered man, and they were, as I now perceive,
made by the feet of this blue monstrosity upon
the table here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; murmured the secretary incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it appeared to me at the time, when,
although I had not then seen the image of the
monkey, I perceived, by the absolutely regular
character of the impressions, that they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
made, not by a living creature, but by the model
of one which had been firmly pressed into the
soft ground at slightly varying intervals. Since
no footprints other than those of Sir Jeffrey were
to be found in the vicinity, I was unable to account
for the presence of the person who had made
these impressions. I devoted myself to a close
scrutiny of those footprints of Sir Jeffrey&rsquo;s which
led up to the scene of the attack. It became
apparent, immediately, that some one had
<em>followed</em> him ... some one who crept silently
along behind the unsuspecting victim ... some
one so clever that he placed his feet <em>almost exactly</em>
in the marks made by the baronet!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! I had accounted for the presence
of the murderer. He struck Sir Jeffrey with
some heavy implement, but failed to stun him.
Then began the struggle, which so churned up the
ground that all tracks were lost. The murderer
prevailed. He was a man of wonderful nerve.
Never once did he place his foot upon virgin
ground; not one imprint by which he might be
identified did he leave behind him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how,&rdquo; inquired Damopolon, who was
hanging upon every word, &ldquo;did he leave the
scene if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; snapped East. &ldquo;I found by the
body the torn paper in which the china image had
been wrapped&mdash;but no string! I went all the way
to London to learn if the parcel had been tied with
string and if Sir Jeffrey had been carrying a stick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; said Damopolon, &ldquo;I could have
saved you the journey, since I was with the late
baronet immediately before he set out for home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so&mdash;but I had another reason for my
visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>East shot a sudden glance from Damopolon
to myself, and there ensued a moment of electric
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beside the track made by the feet of the
image,&rdquo; he resumed slowly, &ldquo;I found a series of
wedge-shaped holes, one on either side of each
monkey-impression. Do you follow me, Mr.
Damopolon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; replied the Greek, taking up and
lighting a cigarette. &ldquo;Wedge-shaped holes, you
say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were the clue for which I sought! I
saw it all! The china ape had been used as a
<em>stepping-stone</em>! The cunning criminal had thus
gained the firm ground in the coppice without
leaving a footprint behind!...&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear East,&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;I cannot
follow you. He stepped from beside the
body on to the image, which he had placed at a
convenient distance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Then, by means of loops of string&mdash;see,
they are still attached!&mdash;he lifted it forward
with his feet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Supporting his weight upon two sticks&mdash;Sir
Jeffrey&rsquo;s and his own! Hence the wedge-shaped
holes beside the track! He had actually
reached firm ground when his own stick snapped
off short, and he made the fatal error of leaving
the fragment and the ferrule, imbedded in the
hole! Here is the fragment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the table East laid a fragment of an ebony
cane, broken off short some three inches above the
nickel ferrule.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ebony is so brittle, is it not, Mr. Damopolon?&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; agreed Damopolon, standing up
as though he believed East to have finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet this stick was made of a particularly
fine piece,&rdquo; added East. &ldquo;Carter!&rdquo; he cried
loudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The library door opened ... and Detective
Sergeant Carter, of New Scotland Yard, entered,
carrying a broken ebony stick. Damopolon
dropped his cigarette, and, whilst he stooped to
recover it:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carter and I went fishing this afternoon,&rdquo;
said East, &ldquo;in the Black Gap. The criminal had
sought to hide the broken cane&mdash;which bears
his monogram&mdash;and also the image. He had
tied them together, filled the image with clay,
and dropped them into the water. Fortunately,
they stuck upon an outstanding mass of weeds,
and we did not fish in vain. Is there any point,
Mr. Damopolon, which I have not made clear?
I don&rsquo;t know what implement you used to strike
Sir Jeffrey, nor do I know what you did with his
ash-stick!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clutching wildly at the table, I rose to my feet,
my gaze set amazedly upon the man thus accused,
upon the man I had called my friend, upon the
man who owed so much to the dead baronet.
And he?... He tossed his cigarette into the
hearth and shrugged his shoulders. But, now,
I saw that he was deathly pale. He began speaking,
in a hoarse, mechanical voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I struck him with a broken elm branch,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;His hat saved him. I completed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
matter with my bare hands. I was desperate.
You need not tell me that Olive&mdash;Miss Baird&mdash;has
confessed to our secret marriage, nor shall I
weary you with the many reasons I had to hate
her father and the pressing need I had for the
fortune which she inherits at his death. It is
finished; I have lost, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carter!&rdquo; cried East. &ldquo;Quick! quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But though the detective, who had been edging
nearer and nearer to the speaker, now sprang upon
him with the leap of a panther, he was too late.
The sound of a muffled shot echoed through The
Warrens, and the Greek fell with an appalling
crash fully over the library table, so that the blue
monkey slid across its polished surface and was
shattered to bits upon the oaken floor!</p>

<h2>The Riddle of Ragstaff</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;Well</span>, Harry, my boy, and what&rsquo;s the
latest news from Venice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harry Lorian stretched his long legs and lay
back in his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a letter from the governor this morning,
Colonel. He appears to be filling his portfolio
with studies of windows and doorways and stair-rails
and the other domestic necessities dear to
his architectural soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colonel Reynor laughed in his short, gruff
way, as my friend, Lorian, gazing sleepily about
the quaint old hall in which we sat, but always
bringing his gaze to one point&mdash;a certain door&mdash;blew
rings of smoke straightly upward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said our host, the Colonel,
&ldquo;most of the material will be used for the forthcoming
book?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; drawled Lorian, glancing for
the twentieth time at the yet vacant doorway
by the stair-foot. &ldquo;The idea of architects and
artists and other constitutionally languid people,
having to write books, fills my soul with black
horror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had a glorious time with our old panelling,
Harry,&rdquo; laughed the Colonel, waving his cigar
vaguely toward the panelled walls and nooks
which gradually were receding into the twilight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my friend. &ldquo;He was here quite
an unconscionable time&mdash;even for an old school
chum of the proprietor. I hope you counted the
spoons when he left!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lorian&rsquo;s disrespectful references to Sir Julius,
his father, were characteristic; for he reverences
that famous artist with the double love of a
son and a pupil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we did,&rdquo; chuckled Reynor.
&ldquo;Nothing missing, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; drawled Lorian. &ldquo;Because
if he didn&rsquo;t steal it from here I can&rsquo;t imagine
from where he stole it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stole what, Harry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever some chap broke into his studio
for last night!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; cried the Colonel, sitting suddenly very
upright. &ldquo;Into your father&rsquo;s studio? Burglars?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose so,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;They took
nothing that I was aware to be in his possession,
though the place was ransacked. I naturally
concluded that they had taken something that
I was <em>unaware</em> to be in his&mdash;&mdash;Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sybil Reynor entered by the door which, for
the past twenty minutes, had been the focus of
Lorian&rsquo;s gaze. The gathering dusk precluded the
possibility of my seeing with certainty, but I
think her face flushed as her dark eyes rested
upon my friend. Her beauty is not of the kind
which needs deceptive half-lights to perfect it,
but there in the dimness, as she came towards
us, she looked very lovely and divinely graceful.
I did not envy Lorian his good fortune; but I
suppressed a sigh when I saw how my existence
had escaped the girl&rsquo;s notice and how the world
in her eyes, contained only a Henry Lorian, R.I.</p>

<p>Her mother entered shortly afterwards and
a general conversation arose, which continued
until the arrival of Ralph Edie and his sister.
They were accompanied by Felix Hulme; and
their advent completed the small party expected
at Ragstaff Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You late arrivals,&rdquo; said Lorian, &ldquo;have only
just time to dress, unless you want to miss
everything but the nuts!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Harry!&rdquo; said Mrs. Reynor, &ldquo;you are
as bad as your father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worse,&rdquo; said Lorian promptly. &ldquo;I am
altogether more rude and have a bigger appetite!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With such seeming trivialities, then, opened
the drama of Ragstaff, the drama in which Fate
had cast four of us for leading rôles.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Following dinner, the men&mdash;or, as my friend
has it, &ldquo;the gunners&rdquo;&mdash;drifted into the hall.
The hall at Ragstaff Park is fitted as a smoking
lounge. It dates back to Tudor days and affords
some magnificent examples of mediæval panelling.
At every point the eye meets the device of a man
with a ragged staff&mdash;from which the place derives
its name, and which is the crest of the Reynors.</p>

<p>A conversation took place to which, at the
time, I attached small importance, but which,
later, assumed a certain significance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extraordinary business,&rdquo; said Felix Hulme&mdash;&ldquo;that
attempted burglary at Sir Julius&rsquo;s studio
last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lorian. &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hulme appeared to be confused by the abrupt
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I heard of it from Baxter,
who has the next studio, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see Baxter?&rdquo; asked Lorian
casually.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Colonel Reynor to my
friend, &ldquo;a number of your father&rsquo;s drawings
are there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Lorian slowly; &ldquo;but the
more valuable ones I have at my own studio,
including those intended for use in his book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in his tone caused me to glance
hard at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they were the burglar&rsquo;s
objective?&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;They would be
worthless to a thief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First I&rsquo;ve heard of this attempt, Lorian,&rdquo;
said Edie. &ldquo;Anything missing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. The thing is an utter mystery. There
were some odds and ends lying about which no
ordinary burglar could very well have overlooked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any loss had been sustained,&rdquo; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Colonel, half jestingly, &ldquo;I should have put it
down to the Riddle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quite follow you. Colonel,&rdquo; remarked
Edie. &ldquo;What riddle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The family Riddle of the Ragstaffs,&rdquo; explained
Lorian. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen it&mdash;over there by the
staircase.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, &ldquo;you mean that
inscription on the panel&mdash;which means nothing
in particular? Yes, I have examined it several
times. But why should it affect the fortunes of
Sir Julius?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; was the Colonel&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;we have
a tradition in the family, Edie, that the Riddle
brings us luck, but brings misfortune to anyone
else who has it in his possession. It&rsquo;s never
been copied before; but I let Lorian&mdash;Sir Julius&mdash;make
a drawing of it for his forthcoming book on
Decorative Wood-carving. I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he
added smilingly, &ldquo;if the mysterious influence
follows the copy or only appertains to the
original.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us have another look at it,&rdquo; said Edie.
&ldquo;It has acquired a new interest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whole party of us passed idly across the
hall to the foot of the great staircase. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
direction of the drawing-room proceeded the
softly played strains of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Duetto</i> from <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cavalleria</i>.
I knew Sybil Reynor was the player, and I saw
Lorian glance impatiently in the direction of the
door. Hulme detected the glance, too, and an
expression rested momentarily upon his handsome
face which I found myself at a loss to define.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the Colonel, holding a candle
close to the time-blackened panel, &ldquo;it is a
meaningless piece of mediæval doggerel roughly
carved in the wood. The oak-leaf border is
very fine, so your father tells me, Harry&rdquo;&mdash;to
Lorian&mdash;&ldquo;but it is probably the work of another
hand, as is the man and ragged staff which form
the shield at the top.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you,&rdquo; asked Hulme,
&ldquo;that the writing might be of a very much later
date&mdash;late Stuart, for instance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the Colonel abruptly, and turned
away. &ldquo;I am sure it is earlier than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not the only member of the party who
noticed the curt tone of his reply; and when we
had all retired for the night I lingered in Lorian&rsquo;s
room and reverted to the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the late Stuart period a sore point with the
Colonel?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Lorian, who was in an unusually thoughtful
mood, lighted his pipe and nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that a Reynor
at about that time turned buccaneer and became
the terror of the two Atlantics! I don&rsquo;t know
what possessed Hulme to say such a thing.
Probably he doesn&rsquo;t know about the piratical
page in the family records, however. He&rsquo;s a
strange chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;Everybody seems to
know him, yet nobody knows anything <em>about</em>
him. I first met him at the Travellers&rsquo; Club.
I was unaware, until I came down here
this time, that the Colonel was one of his
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edie brought him down first,&rdquo; replied Lorian.
&ldquo;But I think Hulme had met Sybil&mdash;Miss Reynor&mdash;in
London, before. I may be a silly ass, but
somehow I distrust the chap&mdash;always have. He
seems to know altogether too much about other
people&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I mentally added that he also took too great
an interest in a certain young lady to suit Lorian&rsquo;s
taste. We chatted upon various matters&mdash;principally
upon the manners, customs, and
manifold beauties of Sybil Reynor&mdash;until my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
friend&rsquo;s pipe went out. Then I bade him good
night and went to my own room.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>With that abruptness characteristic of the coast
and season, a high wind had sprung up since the
party had separated. Now a continuous booming
filled the night, telling how the wrath of the
North Atlantic spent itself upon the western
rocks.</p>

<p>To a town-dweller, more used to the vaguely
soothing hum of the metropolis, this grander
music of the elements was a poor sedative. Sleep
evaded me, tired though I was, and I presently
found myself drifting into that uncomfortable
frame of mind between dreaming and waking,
wherein one&rsquo;s brain becomes a torturing parrot-house,
filled with some meaningless reiteration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The riddle of the ragged staff&mdash;the riddle of
the ragged staff,&rdquo; was the phrase that danced
maddeningly through my brain. It got to that
pass with me, familiar enough to victims of
insomnia, when the words began to go to a sort
of monotonous melody.</p>

<p>Thereupon, I determined to light a candle and
read for a while, in the hope of inducing slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The old clock down in the hall proclaimed the
half-hour. I glanced at my watch. It was
half-past one. The moaning of the wind and the
wild song of the sea continued unceasingly.</p>

<p>Then I dropped my paper&mdash;and listened.</p>

<p>Amid the mighty sounds which raged about
Ragstaff Park it was one slight enough which
had attracted my attention. But in the elemental
music there was a sameness which rendered it,
after a time, negligible. Indeed, I think sleep
was not far off when this new sound detached
itself from the old&mdash;like the solo from its accompaniment.</p>

<p>Something had fallen, crashingly, within the
house.</p>

<p>It might be some object insecurely fastened
which had been detached in the breeze from an
open window. And, realising this, I waited and
listened.</p>

<p>For some minutes the wind and the waves
alone represented sound. Then my ears, attuned
to this stormy conflict, and sensitive to anything
apart from it, detected a faint scratching and
tapping.</p>

<p>My room was the first along the corridor
leading to the west wing, and therefore the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
to the landing immediately above the hall. I
determined that this mysterious disturbance
proceeded from downstairs. At another time,
perhaps, I might have neglected it, but to-night,
and so recently following upon Lorian&rsquo;s story
of the attempt upon his father&rsquo;s studio, I found
myself keenly alive to the burglarious possibilities
of Ragstaff.</p>

<p>I got out of bed, put on my slippers, and,
having extinguished the candle, was about to
open the door when I observed a singular
thing.</p>

<p>A strong light&mdash;which could not be that of
the moon, for ordinarily the corridor beyond
was dark&mdash;shone under the door!</p>

<p>Even as I looked in amazement it was gone.</p>

<p>Very softly I turned the knob.</p>

<p>Careful as I was, it slipped from my grasp with
a faint <em>click</em>. To this, I think, I owed my failure
to see more than I did see. But what I saw was
sufficiently remarkable.</p>

<p>Cloud-banks raced across the sky tempestuously,
and, as I peered over the oaken balustrade down
into the hall, one of these impinged upon the
moon&rsquo;s disc and, within the space of two seconds
or less, had wholly obscured it. Upon where a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
long, rectangular patch of light, splashed with
lozenge-shaped shadows spread from a mullioned
window across the polished floor, crept a band
of blackness&mdash;widened&mdash;claimed half&mdash;claimed
the whole&mdash;and left the hall in darkness.</p>

<p>Yet, in the half-second before the coming of
the cloud, and as I first looked down, I had seen
something&mdash;something indefinable. All but immediately
it was lost in the quick gliding shadow&mdash;yet
I could be sure that I had seen&mdash;what?</p>

<p>A gleaming, metallic streak&mdash;almost I had said
a sword&mdash;which leapt from my view into the
bank of gloom!</p>

<p>Passing the cloud, and the moon anew cutting
a line of light through the darkness of the hall,
nothing, no one, remained to be seen. I might
have imagined the presence of the shining blade,
rod, or whatever had seemed to glitter in the
moon-rays; and I should have felt assured that
such was the case but for the suspicion (and it
was nearly a certainty) that a part of the shadow
which had enwrapped the mysterious appearance
had been of greater depth than the rest&mdash;more
tangible; in short, had been no shadow, but a
substance&mdash;the form of one who lurked there.</p>

<p>Doubtful how to act, and unwilling to disturb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the house without good reason, I stood hesitating
at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>A grating sound, like that of a rusty lock, and
clearly distinguishable above the noise occasioned
by the wind, came to my ears. I began slowly and
silently to descend the stairs.</p>

<p>At the foot I paused, looking warily about me.
There was no one in the hall.</p>

<p>A new cloud swept across the face of the moon,
and utter darkness surrounded me again. I
listened intently, but nothing stirred.</p>

<p>Briefly I searched all those odd nooks and
corners in which the rambling place abounded,
but without discovering anything to account for
the phenomena which had brought me there
at that hour of the night. The big doors were
securely bolted, as were all the windows. Extremely
puzzled, I returned to my room and to
bed.</p>

<p>In the morning I said nothing to our host
respecting the mysterious traffic of the night,
since nothing appeared to be disturbed in any way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear it blowing?&rdquo; asked Colonel
Reynor during breakfast. &ldquo;The booming of the
waves sounded slap under the house. Good job
the wind has dropped this morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, indeed, a warm and still morning,
when on the moorland strip beyond the long
cornfield, where the thick fir-tufts marked the
warren honeycomb, partridges might be met
with in many coveys, basking in the sandy
patches.</p>

<p>There were tunnels through the dense bushes
to the west, too, which led one with alarming
suddenness to the very brink of the cliff. And
here went scurrying many a hare before the
armed intruder.</p>

<p>Lorian and I worked around by lunch-time
to the spinneys east of the cornfield, and, nothing
loath to partake of the substantial hospitalities
of Ragstaff, made our way up to the house.
There is a kind of rock-garden from which you
must approach from that side. It affords an
uninterrupted view of the lower part of the
grounds from the lawn up to the terrace.</p>

<p>Only two figures were in sight; and they
must have been invisible from any other point,
as we, undoubtedly, were invisible to them.</p>

<p>They were those of a man and a girl. They
stood upon the steps leading down from the lawn
to the rose-garden. It was impossible to misunderstand
the nature of the words which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
man was speaking. But I saw the girl turn aside
and shake her head. The man sought to take
her hand and received a further and more decided
rebuff.</p>

<p>We hurried on. Lorian, though I avoided
looking directly at him, was biting his lip. He
was very pale, too. And I knew that he had
recognized, as I had recognized, Sybil Reynor
and Felix Hulme.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>During lunch, a Mr. Findon, who had driven
over with one of the Colonel&rsquo;s neighbours, asked
Sybil Reynor whether the peculiar and far from
beautiful ring which she invariably wore was
Oriental. From his conversation I gathered that
he was something of an expert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is generally supposed to be Ph&oelig;nician,
Mr. Findon,&rdquo; she answered; and slipping it
from her finger she passed it to him. &ldquo;It is
my lot in life to wear it always, hideous though
it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed! An heirloom, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the girl; &ldquo;and an ugly one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In point of fact, the history of the ring was as
curious as that of the Riddle. For generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
it had been worn by the heir of Ragstaff from the
day of his majority to that of his eldest son&rsquo;s.
Colonel Reynor had no son. Hence, following
the tradition as closely as circumstances allowed,
he had invested Sybil with the ring upon the day
that she came of age&mdash;some three months prior
to the time of which I write.</p>

<p>As Mr. Findon was about to return the ring,
Lorian said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me. May I examine it for a moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Sybil.</p>

<p>He took it in his hand and bent over it curiously.
I cannot pretend to explain what impelled me to
glance towards Hulme at that moment; but I
did do so. And the expression which rested upon
his dark and usually handsome face positively
alarmed me.</p>

<p>I concluded that, beneath the cool surface, he
was a man of hot passions, and I would have
ascribed the fixed glare to the jealousy of a rejected
suitor in presence of a more favoured rival, had
it centred upon Lorian. But it appeared to be
focused, particularly, upon the ring.</p>

<p>The incident impressed me very unfavourably.
A sense of mystery was growing up around me&mdash;pervading
the atmosphere of Ragstaff Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>After lunch Lorian and I again set out in company,
but my friend appeared to be in anything
but sporting humour. We bore off at a sharp
angle from the Colonel and some others who were
set upon the rough shooting on the western rim
of the moors and made for the honeycombed
ground which led one upward to the cliff edge.</p>

<p>Abruptly, we found ourselves upon the sheer
brink, with the floor of the ocean at our feet and
all the great Atlantic before us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us relent of our murderous purpose,&rdquo;
said Lorian, dropping comfortably on to a patch
of velvety turf and producing his pipe. &ldquo;I
have dragged you up here with the malicious
intention of talking to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not sorry to hear it. There was much
that I wished to discuss with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have stayed to say something to
some one,&rdquo; he added, carefully stuffing his briar,
&ldquo;but first I wanted to say something to you.&rdquo;
He paused, fumbling for matches. &ldquo;What,&rdquo;
he continued, finding some and striking one,
&ldquo;is Felix Hulme&rsquo;s little game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wants to marry Miss Reynor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know; but he needn&rsquo;t get so infernally
savage because she won&rsquo;t accept him. He looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
at me in a positively murderous way at lunch
to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you noticed that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and I saw that you noticed it, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Leaving Hulme out of the
question, there is an altogether more mysterious
business afoot.&rdquo; And I told him of the episode
of the previous night.</p>

<p>He smoked stolidly whilst I spoke, frowning
the while; then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old chap,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I begin to have a sort
of glimmering of intelligence. I believe I am
threatened with an idea! But it&rsquo;s such an utterly
fantastic hybrid that I dare not name it&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He asked me several questions respecting what
I had seen, and my replies appeared to confirm
whatever suspicion was gathering in his mind.
We saw little enough sport, but came in later
than anyone.</p>

<p>During dinner there was an odd incident.
Lorian said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel, d&rsquo;you mind my taking a picture of
the Riddle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;What for? Your
father made a drawing of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; replied Lorian. &ldquo;I mean a
photograph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; mused the Colonel, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
that there can be much objection, since it has
been copied once. But have you got a camera
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;no,&rdquo; said my friend thoughtfully, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t. Can anybody lend me one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently no one could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you care to drive over to Dr. Mason&rsquo;s
after dinner,&rdquo; said our host, &ldquo;he will lend you
one. He has several.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lorian said he would, and I volunteered to
accompany him. Accordingly the Colonel&rsquo;s high
dogcart was prepared; and beneath a perfect
moon, swimming in a fleckless sky which gave no
hint of the storm to come, we set off for the
doctor&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>My friend&rsquo;s man&oelig;uvres were a constant source
of surprise to me. However, I allowed him to
know his own business best, and employed my
mind with speculations respecting this mystery,
what time the Colonel&rsquo;s spirited grey whisked
us along the dusty roads.</p>

<p>We had just wheeled around Dr. Mason&rsquo;s drive,
when the fact broke in upon my musings that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Stygian darkness had descended upon the night,
as though the moon had been snuffed, candle-wise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Devil of a storm brewing,&rdquo; said Lorian.
&ldquo;Funny how the weather changes at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two minutes after entering the doctor&rsquo;s cosy
study, down came the rain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re in for it!&rdquo; said Mason. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
send Wilkins to run the dogcart into the stable
until it blows over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The storm proved to be a severe one; and long
past midnight, despite the doctor&rsquo;s hospitable
attempts to detain us, we set off for Ragstaff
Park.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can put up the grey ourselves,&rdquo; said
Lorian. &ldquo;I love grooming horses! And by going
around into the yard and throwing gravel up at
his window, we can awaken Peters without arousing
the house. This plan almost startles me by
its daring originality. I fear that I detect within
myself the symptoms of genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, with one of Dr. Mason&rsquo;s cameras under the
seat, we started back through the sweet-smelling
lanes; and, at about twenty minutes past one,
swung past the gate lodge and up the long avenue,
the wheels grinding crisply upon the newly wetted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
gravel. There was but little moon, now, and
the house stood up, an irregular black mass,
before us.</p>

<p>Then, from three of the windows, there suddenly
leapt out a dazzling white light!</p>

<p>Lorian pulled up the grey with a jerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that! An
explosion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But no sound reached us. Only, for some seconds,
the hard, white glare streamed out upon the steps
and down on to the drive. Suddenly as it had
come&mdash;it was gone, and the whole of Ragstaff
was in darkness as before!</p>

<p>The horse started nervously, but my friend
held him with a firm hand, turning and looking
at me queerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what shone under your door last
night!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That light was in the hall!&rdquo;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Peters was awakened, the horse stabled and
ourselves admitted without arousing another soul.
As we came around from the back of the house
(we had not entered by the main door), and,
candles in hand, passed through the hall, nothing
showed as having been disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t breathe a word of our suspicions to
anyone,&rdquo; counselled Lorian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <em>are</em> our suspicions?&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At present,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;indefinable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To-night the distant murmur of the sea
proved very soothing, and I slept soundly. I
was early afoot, however, but not so early as
Lorian. As I passed around the gallery above
the hall, on my way to the bathroom, I saw him
folding up the tripod of the camera which he had
borrowed from Dr. Mason. The morning sun
was streaming through the windows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; Lorian called to me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
a splendid negative, I think. Peters is rigging up
a dark-room in the wine-cellar&mdash;delightful site
for the purpose! Will you join me in developing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although I was unable to conjecture what my
friend hoped to gain by his photographic experiments,
I agreed, prompted as much by curiosity
as anything else. So, after my tub, I descended
to the cellar and splashed about in Hypo., until
Lorian declared himself satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The second is the best,&rdquo; he pronounced
critically, holding the negative up to the red
lamp. &ldquo;I made three exposures in all; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
reflection from the polished wood has rather
spoiled the first and also the third.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever do you want with this photograph,
anyway,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when the original is
available?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear chap,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;one cannot
squat in the hall fixedly regarding a section of
panel like some fakir staring at a palm leaf!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you intend to study it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Closely!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he did not join us during
the whole of the day; but since he spent the
greater part of the time in his own room, I did
not proffer my aid. From a remark dropped by
the Colonel, I gathered that Sybil had volunteered
to assist, during the afternoon, in preparing
prints.</p>

<p>I was one of the first in to tea, and Lorian came
racing out to meet me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but if the Colonel
is agreeable, I shall tell them all at dinner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell them what?&rdquo; I began&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then I saw Sybil Reynor standing in the shadow
of the porch, and, even from that distance, saw
her rosy blushes.</p>

<p>I understood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky man!&rdquo; I cried, and wrung his hand
warmly. &ldquo;The very best of good wishes, old
chap. I am delighted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So am I!&rdquo; replied Lorian. &ldquo;But come and
see the print.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We went into the house together; and Sybil
blushed more furiously than ever when I told her
how I envied Lorian&mdash;and added that he deserved
the most beautiful girl in England, and had won
her.</p>

<p>Lorian had a very clear print of the photograph
pinned up to dry on the side of his window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall be busy to-night!&rdquo; he said mysteriously.</p>

<p>He had planned to preserve his great secret
until dinner-time; but, of course, it came out
whilst we sat over tea on the balcony. The Colonel
was unfeignedly delighted, and there is nothing
secretive about Colonel Reynor. Consequently,
five minutes after he had been informed how
matters were between his daughter and Lorian,
all the house knew.</p>

<p>I studied the face of Hulme, to see how he would
take the news. But he retained a perfect mastery
of himself, though his large dark eyes gleamed at
discord with the smile which he wore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>Our photographic experiments were forgotten;
and throughout dinner, whereat Sybil looked
exquisitely lovely and very shy, and Lorian preserved
an unruffled countenance, other topics ruled.</p>

<p>It was late before we found ourselves alone in
Lorian&rsquo;s room, with the print spread upon the
table beneath the light of the shaded lamp.</p>

<p>We bent over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Lorian, &ldquo;I assume that this is
some kind of cipher!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stared at him surprisedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you and I are going
to solve it if we sit up all night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you propose to begin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as it appears to mean nothing in particular,
as it stands, I thought of beginning by assuming
that the letters have other values altogether.
Therefore, upon the basis that <i>e</i> is the letter which
most frequently occurs in English, with <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>r</i>, afterwards, I had thought of resolving
it into its component letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would that rule apply to mediæval
English?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Lorian thoughtfully, &ldquo;most sage
counsellor! A wise and timely thought! I&rsquo;m
afraid it wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lorian scratched his head in perplexity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;we write down the
words plainly, and see if, treating each one separately,
we can find other meanings to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, upon a sheet of paper, I wrote:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wherso eer thee doome bee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looke untoe ye strypped tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offe ragged staffe. Upon itte ley<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golde toe greene ande kay toe kay.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Our efforts in the proposed direction were
rewarded with poor success. Some gibberish
even less intelligible than the original was the
only result of our labour.</p>

<p>Lorian threw down his pencil and began to
reload his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us consider possible meanings to the
original words,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you know of
anything in the neighbourhood which might
answer to the description of a &lsquo;strypped tree&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has occasioned your sudden interest
in the thing?&rdquo; I asked wearily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;and I
have an idea that there&rsquo;s no time to be lost in
solving the Riddle!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>However, even Lorian&rsquo;s enthusiasm flagged at
last. We were forced to admit ourselves hopelessly
beaten by the Riddle. I went to my own
room feeling thoroughly tired. But I was not
destined to sleep long. A few minutes after
closing my eyes (or so it seemed), came a clamouring
at the door.</p>

<p>I stumbled sleepily out of bed, and, slipping
on my dressing-gown, admitted Lorian. Colonel
Reynor stood immediately behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most extraordinary business!&rdquo; began the
latter breathlessly. &ldquo;Sybil had&mdash;<em>you</em> tell him,
Harry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lorian, &ldquo;it is not unexpected!
Listen: Sybil woke up a while ago, with the idea
that she had forgotten something or lost something&mdash;you
know the frame of mind! She went
to her dressing-table and found the family ring
missing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The</em> ring!&rdquo; burst in the Colonel excitedly.
&ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She remembered having taken it off, during
the evening, to&mdash;er&mdash;to put another one on!
But she was unable to recall having replaced it.
She determined to run down and see if she had
left it upon the seat in the corner of the library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Well, she went downstairs in her dressing-gown,
and, carrying a candle, very quietly, in order to
wake no one, crossed to the library and searched
unavailingly. She heard a faint noise outside
in the hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lorian paused. Felix Hulme had joined the
party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the disturbance?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Lorian, turning to him, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
about Sybil. She was down in the library a
while ago to look for something, and heard a sort
of grating sound out in the hall. She came out,
and almost fell over an iron-bound chest, about
a foot and a half long, which stood near the
bottom of the staircase!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Lorian!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;how had
it come there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sybil says,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;that she could
not believe her eyes. She stooped to examine
the thing ... and with a thrill of horror saw
it to be roughly marked <em>with a skull and cross-bones</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Lorian,&rdquo; said Hulme, &ldquo;are you
certain that Miss Reynor was awake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She woke <em>us</em> quickly enough!&rdquo; interrupted
the Colonel. &ldquo;Poor girl, she was shaking dreadfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Thought it was a supernatural appearance.
She&rsquo;s with her mother now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the box!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Where is the
box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the mystery,&rdquo; answered Colonel Reynor.
&ldquo;I was downstairs two minutes later, and
there was nothing of the kind to be seen! Has
our Ragstaff ghost started walking again, I
wonder? You ought to know, Hulme; you&rsquo;re in
the Turret Room&mdash;that is the authentic haunted
chamber!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was aroused by the bell ringing,&rdquo; replied
Hulme. &ldquo;I am a very light sleeper. But I
heard or saw nothing supernatural.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, Hulme,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;the
Turret Room is directly above the hall. I have
a theory. Might I come up with you for a
moment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Hulme.</p>

<p>We all went up to the Turret Room. Having
climbed the stairs to this apartment, you enter
it by descending three steps. It is octagonal
and panelled all around. My friend tapped the
panels and sounded all the oaken floor-boards.
Then, professing himself satisfied, he bade Hulme
good night, and accompanied me to my room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Ragstaff Park slumbered once more. But
Lorian sat upon the edge of my bed, smoking
and thinking hard. He had been to his own
room for the print of the Riddle, and it lay upon
a chair before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen to this,&rdquo; he said suddenly: &ldquo;(<i>a</i>) Some
one breaks into the governor&rsquo;s studio, and takes
nothing. His drawings of the Ragstaff Riddle
happen to be at my studio. (<i>b</i>) You hear a noise
in the night, and see (1) a bright light; (2) a
gleaming rod. (<i>c</i>) You and I see a bright light
on the following night, and presumably proceeding
from the same place; i.e., the hall. (<i>d</i>) Something
I have not mentioned before&mdash;Hulme has
a camera in his kit! And he doesn&rsquo;t want the
fact known!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tested him the other night, by inquiring if
anyone could lend me a camera. He did not
volunteer! The morning following the mysterious
business in the hall, observed by you, I
saw a photographic printing frame in his window!
He must have one of those portable developers
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And to what does all this point?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the fact that he has made at least three
attempts to obtain a copy of the Riddle, and has
at last succeeded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really think so. The evidence points to
him as the person who broke into the studio. He
made a bad slip. He referred to the matter, and
cited Horace Baxter as his informant. Baxter
is away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this is serious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say so! He couldn&rsquo;t attempt to
photograph the panel in daylight, so he employed
magnesium ribbon at night! First time his
tripod slipped. It is evidently one of the light,
telescopic kind. His negative proved useless.
It was one of the metal legs of the tripod which
you saw shining! The second time he was more
successful. That was the light of his magnesium
ribbon you and I saw from the drive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Lorian, I went down and searched the
hall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we come on to the, at present, conjectural
part,&rdquo; explained Lorian. &ldquo;My theory is that
Hulme, somewhere or other, has come across
some old documents which give the clue to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
secret passages said to exist in Ragstaff, but which
the Colonel has never been able to locate. I feel
assured that there is some means of secret communication
between the Turret Room and the
hall. I further believe that Hulme has in some
way got upon the track of another secret&mdash;that
of the Riddle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what <em>is</em> the secret of the Riddle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In my opinion the Riddle is a clue to another
hiding-place, evidently not connected with the
maze of passages; possibly what is known as a
Priest&rsquo;s Hole. As you know, Hulme asked
Sybil to marry him. I believe the man to be in
financial straits; so that we must further assume
the Riddle to conceal the whereabouts of a treasure,
since the Reynors are far from wealthy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <em>chest</em>! Lorian! The chest!&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so. But what immediately preceded
its appearance? The loss of the family ring!
If I am not greatly in error, Hulme found that
ring! And the ring is the key to the riddle!
Do you recall the shape of the bezel? Simply
<em>a square peg of gold</em>! Look at the photograph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was excited, for once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it say?&rdquo; he continued: &ldquo;&lsquo;Ye
strypped tree!&rsquo; That means the device of leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
twigs, and acorns&mdash;stripped <em>from</em> a tree&mdash;see?
Here, at the bottom of the panel, is such a group,
and (this is where we have been so blind!) intertwined
with the design is the word <em>CAEG</em>&mdash;Ancient
Saxon for <em>key</em>! Look! &lsquo;Golde toe
Greene and kay toe kay&rsquo;! Amongst the <em>green</em>
leaves is a square hole. The <em>gold</em> knob on the
ring fits it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment I was too greatly surprised for
speech. Then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think Hulme discovered this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do. And I think Sybil&rsquo;s mislaying her
ring gave him his big chance. He had got the
chest out whilst she was in the library. He must
have been inside somewhere looking for it when
she passed through the hall. Then, hearing her
approach from the library, he was forced to abandon
his heavy &lsquo;find&rsquo; and hide in the secret
passage which communicates with his room.
Directly she ran upstairs he returned for the
chest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I looked him hard in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want a scene, Lorian,&rdquo; I began.
&ldquo;Besides, it&rsquo;s just possible you may be wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; said Lorian. &ldquo;Come up to his
room, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing quietly upstairs, we paused before the
door of the Turret Room. A faint light showed
under it. Lorian glanced at me&mdash;then knocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; came sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lorian,&rdquo; answered my friend. &ldquo;I want a
chat with you about the secret passage and the
old treasure chest&mdash;<em>before speaking to the Colonel</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence, then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; came hoarsely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
come in until I call.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We looked at one another doubtfully. A long
minute passed. I could hear a faint sound within.
At last came Hulme&rsquo;s voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Lorian threw the door open, a faint <em>click</em>
sounded from somewhere.</p>

<p>The Turret Room was empty!</p>

<p>&ldquo;By heaven! he&rsquo;s given us the slip!&rdquo; cried
my friend.</p>

<p>We glanced around the room. A candle burnt
upon the table. And upon the bed stood an
iron-barred chest, with a sheet of notepaper
lying on its lid!</p>

<p>Lorian pounced upon the note. We read it
together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henry Lorian&rdquo; (it went), &ldquo;I realize that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
you have found me out. I will confess that I had
no time to open the chest. But as matters stand
I only ask you not to pursue me. I have taken
nothing not my own. The ring, and an interesting
document which I picked up some years ago,
are on the table. Offer what explanation of my
disappearance you please. I am in your hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We turned again to the table. Upon a piece
of worn parchment lay the missing ring. Lorian
spread out the parchment and bent over it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;it is a plan of Ragstaff
Park!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a perfect network of secret passages!&rdquo;
added my friend, &ldquo;and some instructions, apparently,
as to how to enter them. It bears the
initials &lsquo;R.&nbsp;R.&rsquo; and, in brackets, &lsquo;Capt. S.&rsquo; I
begin to understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised the candle and stepped across to the
ancient chest. It bore a roughly designed skull
and cross-bones, and, in nearly defaced red
characters, the words:</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>CAPTAIN SATAN</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Satan!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He was one of
the most bloodthirsty pirates who ever harried
the Spanish Main!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He was,&rdquo; agreed Lorian; &ldquo;and his real name
was Roderick Reynor. He evidently solved the
riddle some generations earlier than Hulme&mdash;and
stored his bloodstained hoard in the ancient hiding-place.
Also, you see, he knew about the
passages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hulme has surrendered. You can see that
the chest has not been opened. Therefore there
is only one thing that we <em>can</em> do. We must keep
what we know to ourselves, return the chest to
its hiding-place, and proclaim that we have found
the missing ring!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down to the hall we bore the heavy chest.
The square knob on the ring fitted, as Lorian had
predicted, into the hole half hidden among the
oak leaves of the design. Without much difficulty
we forced back the fastening (it proved
to be of a very simple pattern), and slid the whole
panel aside. A small, square chamber was revealed
by the light of the candle&mdash;quite empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I had surmised,&rdquo; said my friend; &ldquo;a
Priest&rsquo;s Hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We carried the chest within, and reclosed the
panel, which came to with a sharp <em>click</em>.</p>

<p class="ast">*****</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>The story which we invented to account for
Hulme&rsquo;s sudden departure passed muster; for
one topic usurped the interests of all&mdash;the ghostly
box, with its piratical emblem.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boy,&rdquo; Colonel Reynor said to Lorian,
&ldquo;I cannot pretend to explain what Sybil saw.
But it bears curiously upon a certain black page in
the family history. If the chest had been tangible,
and had contained a fortune, I would not
have opened it. Let all pertaining to that part
of our records remain buried, say I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which determines our course,&rdquo; explained
Lorian to me. &ldquo;The chest is not ours, and the
Colonel evidently would rather not know about
it. I regret that I lack the morals of a burglar.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Master of Hollow Grange</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Jack Dillon</span> came to Hollow Grange on a
thunderous black evening when an ebony
cloud crested the hill-top above, and, catching
the upflung rays of sunset, glowed redly like
the pall of Avalon in the torchlight. Through
the dense ranks of firs cloaking the slopes a
breeze, presaging the coming storm, whispered
evilly, and here in the hollow the birds were still.</p>

<p>The man who had driven him from the station
glanced at him, with a curiosity thinly veiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about your things, sir?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>Dillon stared rather blankly at the ivy-covered
lodge, which, if appearances were to be trusted,
was unoccupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment; I will ring,&rdquo; he said curtly;
for this furtive curiosity, so ill concealed, had
manifested itself in the manner of the taxi-driver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
from the moment that Dillon had directed him
to drive to Hollow Grange.</p>

<p>He pushed open the gate and tugged at the
iron ring which was suspended from the wall of
the lodge. A discordant clangour rewarded his
efforts, the cracked note of a bell that spoke from
somewhere high up in the building, that seemed
to be buffeted to and fro from fir to fir, until
it died away, mournfully, in some place of
shadows far up the slope. In the voice of the
bell there was something furtive, something akin
to the half-veiled curiosity in the eyes of the
man who stood watching him; something fearful,
too, in both, as though man and bell would
whisper: &ldquo;Return! Beware of disturbing the
dwellers in this place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dillon angrily recalled himself to the
realities. He felt that these ghostly imaginings
were born of the Boche-maltreated flesh, were
products of lowered tone; that he would have
perceived no query in the glance of the taxi-driver
and heard no monkish whisper in the
clang of the bell had he been fit, had he been
fully recovered from the effects of his wound.
Monkish whisper? Yes, that was it&mdash;his mind
had supplied, automatically, an aptly descriptive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
term: the cracked bell spoke with the voice
of ancient monasteries, had in it the hush of
cloisters and the sigh of renunciation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it all!&rdquo; muttered Dillon. &ldquo;This
won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A second time he awoke the ghostly bell-voice,
but nothing responded to its call; man, bird,
and beast had seemingly deserted Hollow Grange.
He was conscious of a sudden nervous irritation,
as he turned brusquely and met the inquiring
glance of the taxi-man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have arrived before I was expected,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;If you will put my things in the porch here I
will go up to the house and get a servant to fetch
them. They will be safe enough in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His own words increased his irritability; for
were they not in the nature of an apology on
behalf of his silent and unseen host? Were
they not a concession to that nameless query
in the man&rsquo;s stare? Moreover, deep within his
own consciousness, some vague thing was stirring;
so that, the man dismissed and promptly departing,
Dillon stood glancing from the little stack
of baggage in the lodge porch up the gloomy,
narrow, and over-arched drive, indignantly aware
that he also carried a question in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The throb of the motor mounting the steep,
winding lane grew dim and more dim until it
was borne away entirely upon the fitful breeze.
Faintly he detected the lowing of cattle in some
distant pasture; the ranks of firs whispered
secretly one to another, and the pall above the
hills grew blacker and began to extend over
the valley.</p>

<p>Amid that ominous stillness of nature he began
to ascend the cone-strewn path. Evidently
enough, the extensive grounds had been neglected
for years, and that few pedestrians, and fewer
vehicles, ever sought Hollow Grange was demonstrated
by the presence of luxuriant weeds in
the carriage way. Having proceeded for some
distance, until the sheer hillside seemed to loom
over him like the wall of a tower, Dillon paused,
peering about in the ever-growing darkness. He
was aware of a physical chill; certainly no ray
of sunlight ever penetrated to this tunnel through
the firs. Could he have mistaken the path and
be proceeding, not toward the house, but away
from it and into the midnight of the woods
mantling the hills?</p>

<p>There was something uncomfortable in that
reflection; momentarily he knew a childish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fear of the darkening woods, and walked forward
rapidly, self-assertively. Ten paces brought him
to one of the many bends in the winding road&mdash;and
there, far ahead, as though out of some
cavern in the very hillside, a yellow light shone.</p>

<p>He pressed on with greater assurance until
the house became visible. Now he perceived that
he had indeed strayed from the carriage-sweep
in some way, for the path that he was following
terminated at the foot of a short flight of moss-covered
brick steps. He mounted the steps and
found himself at the bottom of a terrace. The
main entrance was far to his left and separated
from the terrace by a neglected lawn. That
portion of the place was Hanoverian and ugly,
whilst the wing nearest to him was Tudor and
picturesque. Excepting the yellow light shining
out from a sunken window almost at his feet,
no illuminations were visible about the house,
although the brewing storm had already plunged
the hollow into premature night.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was no sign of occupancy about
the strange-looking mansion, which might have
hidden forgotten for centuries in the horseshoe
of the hills. He had sought for rest and quiet;
here he should find them. The stillness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
place was of that sort which almost seems to
be palpable; that can be seen and felt. A
humid chill arose apparently from the terrace,
with its stone pavings outlined in moss, crept
up from the wilderness below and down from the
fir-woods above.</p>

<p>A thought struggled to assume form in his
mind. There was something reminiscent about
this house of the woods, this silent house which
struck no chord of human companionship, in
which was no warmth of life or love. Suddenly,
the thought leapt into complete being.</p>

<p>This was the palace of the sleeping beauty to
which he had penetrated. It was the fairy-tale
dear to childhood which had been struggling for
expression in his mind ever since he had emerged
from the trees on to the desolate terrace. With
the departure of the station cab had gone the
last link with to-day, and now he was translated
to the goblin realm of fable.</p>

<p>He had crossed the terrace and the lawn, and
stood looking through an open French window
into a room that evidently adjoined the hall.
A great still darkness had come, and on a little
table in the room a reading-lamp was burning.
It had a quaint, mosaic shade which shut in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
much of the light, but threw a luminous patch
directly on a heap of cushions strewn upon the
floor. Face downward in this silken nest, her
chin resting upon her hands and her elfin curly
brown hair tousled bewitchingly, lay a girl so
audaciously pretty that Dillon hesitated to
accept the evidence of his eyes.</p>

<p>The crunching of a piece of gravel beneath his
foot led to the awakening of the sleeping beauty.
She raised her head quickly and then started
upright, a lithe, divinely petite figure in a green
velvet dress, having short fur-trimmed sleeves
that displayed her pretty arms. For an instant
it was a startled nymph that confronted him;
then a distracting dimple appeared in one fair
cheek, and:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how you frightened me!&rdquo; said the
girl, speaking with a slight French accent which
the visitor found wholly entrancing. &ldquo;You
must be Jack Dillon? I am Phryné.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dillon bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How I envy Hyperides!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>A blush quickly stained the lovely face of
Phryné, and the roguish eyes were lowered,
whereby the penitent Dillon, who had jested in
the not uncommon belief that a pretty girl is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
necessarily brainless, knew that the story of the
wonder-woman of Thespiæ was familiar to her
modern namesake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; declared Phryné, with a return
of her mischievous composure, &ldquo;that you are
very wicked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dillon, who counted himself a man of the
world, was temporarily at a loss for a suitable
rejoinder. The cause of his hesitancy was twofold.
In the first place he had reached the age
of disillusionment, whereat a man ceases to
believe that a perfectly lovely woman exists in
the flesh, and in the second place he had found
such a fabulous being in a house of gloom and
silence to which, a few moments ago, he had
deeply regretted having come.</p>

<p>His father, who had accepted the invitation
from an old college friend on his son&rsquo;s behalf,
had made no mention of a Phryné, whereas
Phryné clearly took herself for granted and
evidently knew all about Jack Dillon. The
latter experienced a volcanic change of sentiment;
Hollow Grange was metamorphosed, and assumed
magically the guise of a Golden House, an
Emperor&rsquo;s pleasure palace, a fair, old-world
casket holding this lovely jewel. But who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
she?&mdash;and in what spirit should he receive her
bewildering coquetries?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust,&rdquo; he said, looking into the laughing
eyes, &ldquo;that you will learn to know me better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phryné curtsied mockingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have either too much confidence in
your own character or not enough in my wisdom,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>Dillon stepped into the room, and, stooping,
took up a book which lay open upon the floor.
It was a French edition of <i>The Golden Ass</i> of
Apuleius.</p>

<p>The hollow was illuminated by a blinding flash
of lightning, and Phryné&rsquo;s musical laughter was
drowned in the thunder that boomed and crashed
in deepening peals over the hills. In a sudden
tropical torrent the rain descended, as Dr.
Kassimere entered the room.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Jack Dillon leant from his open window and
looked out over the valley to where a dull red
glow crowned the hill-top. There was a fire
somewhere in the neighbourhood of the distant
town; probably a building had been struck by
lightning. The storm had passed, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
thunder was still audible dimly, like the roll of
muffled drums or a remote bombardment. Stillness
had reclaimed Hollow Grange.</p>

<p>He was restless, uneasy; he sought to collate
his impressions of the place and its master.
Twelve years had elapsed since his one previous
meeting with Dr. Kassimere, and little or no
memory of the man had remained. So much had
intervened; the war&mdash;and Phryné. Now that
he was alone and could collect his ideas he knew
of what Dr. Kassimere&rsquo;s gaunt, wide-eyed face
had reminded him: it was of Thoth, the Ibis-headed
god whose figure he had seen on the walls
of the temples during his service in Egypt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kassimere was always a queer fish, Jack,&rdquo;
his father had said; &ldquo;but most of his eccentricities
were due to his passion for study. The
Grange is the very place Sir Francis&rdquo; (the
specialist) &ldquo;would have chosen for your convalescence,
and you&rsquo;ll find nothing dangerously
exciting in Kassimere&rsquo;s atmosphere!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet there was that about Dr. Kassimere
which he did not and could not like; his quietly
cordial welcome, his courteous regret that his
guest&rsquo;s arrival by an earlier train (a circumstance
due to reduced service) had led to his not being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
met at the station; the charming simplicity
with which he confessed to the smallness of his
household, and to the pleasure which it afforded
him to have the son of an old chum beneath his
roof&mdash;all these kindly overtures had left the
bird-like eyes cold, hard, watchful, calculating.
The voice was the voice of a friend and a gentleman,
but the face was the face of Thoth.</p>

<p>The mystery of Phryné was solved in a measure.
She was Dr. Kassimere&rsquo;s adopted daughter and
the orphaned child of Louis Devant, the famous
Paris cartoonist, who had died penniless in 1911,
at the height of his success. In his selection of
a name for her, the brilliant and dissolute artist
had exhibited a breadth of mind which Phryné
inherited in an almost embarrassing degree.</p>

<p>Her mental equipment was bewildering: the
erudition of an Oxford don spiced with more
than a dash of Boul&rsquo; Mich&rsquo;, which made for
complexity. Her curious learning was doubtless
due to the setting of a receptive mind amid
such environment, but how she had retained
her piquant vivacity in Hollow Grange was less
comprehensible. The servants formed a small
and saturnine company, only two&mdash;the housekeeper,
Mrs. Harman, a black and forbidding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
figure, and Madame Charny, a French companion&mdash;sleeping
in the house. Gawly, a surly creature
who neglected the gardens and muttered savagely
over other duties, together with his wife, who
cooked, resided at the lodge. There were two
maids, who lived in the village....</p>

<p>The glow from the distant fire seemed to be
reflected upon the firs bordering the terrace
below; then Dillon, watching the dull, red light,
remembered that Dr. Kassimere&rsquo;s laboratory
adjoined the tiny chapel, and that, though midnight
drew near, the doctor was still at work there.</p>

<p>Owls and other night birds hooted and shrieked
among the trees and many bats were in flight.
He found himself thinking of the pyramid bats
of Egypt, and of the ibis-headed Thoth who was
the scribe of the under-world.</p>

<p>Dr. Kassimere had made himself medically
responsible for his case, and had read attentively
the letters which Dillon had brought from his
own physician. He was to prescribe on the
following day, and to-night the visitor found
Morpheus a treacherous god. Furtive activities
disturbed the house, or so it seemed to the
sleepless man tossing on his bed; alert intelligences
within Hollow Grange responded to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
night-life of the owls without, and he seemed
to lie in the shadow of a watchfulness that never
slumbered.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a fine walk hereabouts,&rdquo; said
the old man seated in the arm-chair in the corner
of the <i>Threshers&rsquo; Inn</i> bar-parlour.</p>

<p>Dillon nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Ganton-on-the-Hill,&rdquo; continued the
ancient. &ldquo;You can see the sea from there in
clear weather; and many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve heard
the guns in France from Upper Crobury of a
still night. Then, four mile away, there&rsquo;s the
haunted Grange, though nobody&rsquo;s allowed past
the gate. Not as nobody wants to be,&rdquo; he added,
reflectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The haunted Grange?&rdquo; questioned Dillon.
&ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hollow Grange?&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Why,
it lies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Hollow Grange&mdash;yes! I know where
Hollow Grange is, but I was unaware that it was
reputed to be haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied the other, pityingly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
new to these parts; I see that the minute I set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
eyes on you. Maybe you was wounded in France,
and you&rsquo;re down here to get well, like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so. Your deductive reasoning is
admirable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the sage, chuckling with self-appreciation,
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t lived in these here parts
for nigh on seventy-five years without learning
to use my eyes, I ain&rsquo;t. For seventy-four years
and seven months,&rdquo; he added proudly, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
been outside this here county where I was born,
and I can use my eyes, I can; I know a thing
I do, when I see it. Maybe it was providence,
as you might say, what brought you to the
<i>Threshers</i> to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite possibly,&rdquo; Dillon admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was just such another as you,&rdquo; continued
the old man with apparent irrelevance. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
happen to be stopping at Hainingham Vicarage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Dillon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! he was stopping at Hainingham Vicarage
and he&rsquo;d been wounded in France. How he got
to know Dr. Kassimere I can&rsquo;t tell you; not at
parson&rsquo;s, anyway. Parson won&rsquo;t never speak
to him. Only last Sunday week he preached
agin him; not in so many words, but I could
see his drift. He spoke about them heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
women livin&rsquo; on an island&mdash;sort of female
Robinson Crusoes, I make &rsquo;em out, I do&mdash;as
saves poor shipwrecked sailors from the sea and
strangles of &rsquo;em ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dillon glanced hard at the voluble old man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sirens?&rdquo; he suggested, conscious of a
sudden hot surging about his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the women I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is the connection?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re new to these parts, you are.
That Dr. Kassimere he keeps a siren down in
Hollow Grange. They see her&mdash;these here
strangers (same as the shipwrecked sailors parson
told about)&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all up with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dillon stifled a laugh, in which anger would
have mingled with contempt. To think that in
the twentieth century a man of science was like
to meet with the fate of Dr. Dee in the days of
Elizabeth! Truly there were dark spots in
England. But could he credit the statement of
this benighted elder that a modern clergyman
had actually drawn an analogy between Phryné
Devant and the sirens? It was unbelievable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the unhappy fate,&rdquo; he asked,
masking his intolerance, &ldquo;of the young man
staying at the Vicarage?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The same as them afore him,&rdquo; came the
startling reply; &ldquo;for he warn&rsquo;t the first, and
maybe&rdquo;&mdash;with a shrewd glance of the rheumy
old eyes&mdash;&ldquo;he won&rsquo;t be the last. Them sirens
has the powers of darkness. I know, &rsquo;cause
I&rsquo;ve seen one&mdash;her at the Grange; and though
I&rsquo;m an old man, nigh on seventy-five, I&rsquo;ll never
forget her face, I won&rsquo;t, and the way she smiled
at me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; persisted Dillon, patiently, &ldquo;what
became of this particular young man, the one
who was staying at the Vicarage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ancient sage leant forward in his chair
and tapped the speaker upon the knee with the
stem of his clay pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask them as knows,&rdquo; he said, with impressive
solemnity. &ldquo;Nobody else can tell you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, having permitted an indiscreet laugh to
escape him, not another word on the subject
could Dillon induce the old man to utter, he
strictly confining himself, in his ruffled dignity,
to the climatic conditions and the crops.</p>

<p>When Dillon, finally, set out upon the four-mile
walk back to the Grange, he realised, with
annoyance, that the senile imaginings of his
bar-parlour acquaintance lingered in his mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
That Dr. Kassimere dwelt outside the social
life of the county he had speedily learnt; but
for this he had been prepared. That he might
possibly be, not a recluse, but a pariah, was a
new point of view. Trivial things, to which
hitherto he had paid scant attention, began to
marshal themselves as evidence. The two village
&ldquo;helpers,&rdquo; he knew, received extravagant wages,
because, as Phryné had confessed, they had
&ldquo;found it almost impossible to get girls to stay.&rdquo;
Why?</p>

<p>Of the earlier guest, or guests, who had
succumbed to the siren lure of Phryné, he had
heard no mention. Why? Save at meal-times
he rarely saw his host, who frankly left him
to the society of Phryné. Again&mdash;why? Dr.
Kassimere, in his jealously locked laboratory,
was at work day and night upon his experiments.
What were these experiments? What was the
nature of the doctor&rsquo;s studies?</p>

<p>He had now been for nearly three weeks at
Hollow Grange, and never had Dr. Kassimere
spoken of his work. And Phryné? The sudden,
new thought of Phryné was so strange, so wonderful
and overwhelming, that it reacted physically;
and he pulled up short in the middle of a field-path,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
as though some palpable obstacle blocked
the way.</p>

<p>Why had he set out alone that day, when all
other days had been spent in the girl&rsquo;s company?
He had deliberately sought solitude&mdash;because of
Phryné; because he wanted to think calmly,
judicially, to arraign himself before his own
judgment, remote from the witchery of her
presence. He had tried to render his mind a
void, wherein should linger not one fragrant
memory of her delicate beauty and charm, so
that he might return unbiased to his judgment.
He had returned; he was judged.</p>

<p>He loved Phryné madly, insanely. His future,
his life, lay in the hollow of her hands.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Phryné, &ldquo;it is true. There
were two of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&rdquo;&mdash;Dillon hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;were they in love
with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Phryné, naïvely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phryné shook her curly head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I rather liked the French boy, but I do not
believe anything that a Frenchman says to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
girl; and Harry, the other, was handsome, but
so silly....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you did not love either of them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Dillon, and impulsively he swept
her into his arms, &ldquo;you are going to love me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One quick upward glance she gave, but instantly
lowered her eyes and withheld her bewitching
face from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;You are so
conceited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as she spoke the words he kissed her, and
she surrendered sweetly, nestling her head against
his shoulder for a moment. Then, leaping back,
bright-eyed and blushing, she turned and ran
like a startled fawn across the terrace and into
the house.</p>

<p>He saw no more of her until dinner-time, and
spent the interval in a kind of suspended consciousness
that was new and perturbing. Within him
life pulsed at delirious speed, but the universe
seemed to have slowed upon its course so that
each hour became as two. Throughout dinner,
Phryné was deliciously shy to the point of
embarrassment; and Dillon, who several times
surprised the bird-eyes of Dr. Kassimere studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the girl&rsquo;s face, detained his host, and being a
young man of orderly mind, formally asked his
consent to an engagement.</p>

<p>The doctor&rsquo;s joy was seemingly so unfeigned
that Dillon almost liked him for a moment.
He placed no obstacle in the path of the suitor
for his adopted daughter&rsquo;s hand, graciously
expressing every confidence in the future. His
joy was genuine enough, Dillon determined; but
from what source did it actually spring? The
Thoth-like eyes were exultant, and all the old
mistrust poured back in a wave upon the younger
man. Was this distrust becoming an obsession?
Why should he eternally be seeking an ulterior
motive for every act in this man&rsquo;s life?</p>

<p>He went to look for Phryné, and found her in
the spot where he had first seen her, prone in a
nest of cushions. She sprang up as he entered
the room, and glanced at him in that new way
which set his heart leaping....</p>

<p>And because of the magic of her presence, it
was not until later, when he stood alone in his
own room, that he could order the facts gleaned
from her.</p>

<p>There was some grain of truth in the story of
the ancient gossip at the <i>Threshers</i> after all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
A young French lieutenant of artillery had
received an invitation to spend a leave at Hollow
Grange. His Gallic soul had been fired by Phryné&rsquo;s
beauty, and although his advances had been met
with rebuff, he had asked Dr. Kassimere&rsquo;s permission
to pay his court to the girl. On the same
evening he had departed hurriedly, and Phryné
had supposed, since the doctor never referred to
him again, that he had been sent about his business.
Then came a strange letter, which Phryné
had shown to Dillon. Its tone throughout was
of passionate anger, and one passage recurred
again and again to Dillon&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;I would
give my life for you gladly,&rdquo; it read, &ldquo;but my
soul belongs to God....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Phryné had counted him demented and Dr.
Kassimere had agreed with her. But there was
Harry Waynwright, the nephew of the vicar of
St. Peter&rsquo;s at Hainingham. An accidental meeting
with Phryné had led to a courtesy call&mdash;and
the inevitable. It had all the seeming of a case
of love-sickness, and the unhappy youth grew
seriously ill. From pestering her daily he changed
his tactics to studiously avoiding her, until,
meeting her in the village one morning, he
greeted her with, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it, Phryné! tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
him I can&rsquo;t do it. He can rely upon my word;
but I&rsquo;m going away to try to forget!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Kassimere had professed entire ignorance
of the meaning of the words. A faint shadow had
crossed Phryné&rsquo;s face as she spoke of these
matters, but, as a result of her extraordinary
beauty, she was somewhat callous where languishing
admirers were concerned, and she had
dismissed the gloomy twain with a shrug of her
charming shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mad!&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;It seems my fate
always to meet mad-men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night silence had descended again upon
Hollow Grange, disturbed only by the mournful
cry of the owl and the almost imperceptible note
of the bat. But to the nervous alertness of
Dillon, a deep unrest seemed to stir within the
house; yet&mdash;an unrest not physical but spiritual;
it was as the shadow of a sleepless watcher&mdash;a
shadow creeping over his soul.</p>

<p>What was the explanation lying at the back of
it all? Vainly he sought for a theory, however
wild, however improbable, that should embrace
all the facts known to him and serve either to
banish his black doubts or to focus them. Upon
one thing he had determined: There was some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
thing or some one in Hollow Grange that he
<em>feared</em>, some centre from whence fear radiated.</p>

<p>Phryné, for one fleeting moment, had revealed
to him that she, too, had known this formless
dread, but only latterly; probably from lack of
a more definite date, she had spoken of this fear
as first visiting her at about the time of the
Frenchman&rsquo;s advent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slowly, he has changed towards me,&rdquo; she had
whispered, referring to Dr. Kassimere. &ldquo;He
watches me, sometimes, in a strange way. Oh,
he has been so good, so very kind and good, but&mdash;I
shall be glad when&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Could some part of the mystery be explained
away by the doctor&rsquo;s increasing absorption in his
studies, which led him to regard the charge of a
ward, and a wayward one at that, as unduly
onerous and disturbing? Might it not fairly be
supposed that ignorant superstition and the
ravings of unrequited passion accounted for the
rest?</p>

<p>At the nature of Dr. Kassimere&rsquo;s studies he
could not even guess. The greater number of
the works in the library related to mysticism in
one form or another, although there was a sprinkling
of exact science to leaven the whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He can rely upon my word,&rdquo; Waynwright
had said. Regarding what, or regarding whom,
had he given his word?</p>

<p>The cry of a night-hawk came, as if in answer;
the hoot of an owl, as if in mockery. Out beyond
the terrace a dull red light showed from Dr.
Kassimere&rsquo;s laboratory.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Enlightenment came about in this fashion&mdash;seeking
to quench a feverish thirst, Dillon discovered
that no glass had been left in his room.
He determined to fetch one from the buffet cupboard
downstairs. Softly, in slippered feet, he
descended the stairs and was crossing the hallway
when he kicked something&mdash;a small book, he
thought&mdash;that lay there upon the floor. Groping,
he found it, slipped it into the pocket of his
dressing-gown, and entered the dining-room. He
found a tumbler without difficulty, in the dark,
noted the presence of a heavy, oppressive odour,
and returned upstairs. Now he made another
discovery. He had forgotten the nightly draught
of medicine prescribed by Dr. Kassimere; a new
unopened phial stood upon the dressing-table.</p>

<p>He mixed himself a mild whisky and soda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
from the decanter and siphon which his host&rsquo;s
hospitality caused nightly to be placed in his
room, and then, seized by a sudden thought, took
out the little book which he had found in the
hall.</p>

<p>It was a faded manuscript, in monkish Latin;
a copy of an unpublished work of Paracelsus.
Many passages had been rendered into English,
and the translations, in Dr. Kassimere&rsquo;s minute,
cramped writing, were interposed between the
bound pages. In these again were interpolated
marginal notes, some in the shape of unintelligible
symbols, others in that of chemical formulæ.
Several passages were marked in red ink. And,
having perused the first of these which he chanced
upon, a clammy moisture broke out upon his
skin, accompanied by so marked a nervous
trembling that he was forced to seat himself
upon the bed.</p>

<p>The secret of this man&rsquo;s ghastly life-work was
in his hands; he knew, now, what bargain Dr.
Kassimere had proposed to the Frenchman and
to the other; he knew why he had adopted the
lovely daughter of Louis Devant&mdash;and he knew
why he, Jack Dillon, had been invited to Hollow
Grange. That such a ghoul in human shape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
could live and have his being amid ordinary
mankind was a stupendous improbability which,
ten minutes earlier, he would have laughed to
scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His glance fell upon the unopened phial on his
dressing-table, and from his soul a silent thanksgiving
rose to heaven that he had left that potion
untasted. He realised that his own case differed
from those of his predecessors in two particulars:
He was actually in residence under Dr. Kassimere&rsquo;s
roof and receiving treatment from the
man&rsquo;s hands. No option was to be offered to
<em>him</em>; the great experiment, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnum Opus</i>,
was to be performed without his consent!</p>

<p>And Phryné!&mdash;Phryné, the other innocent
victim of this fiend&rsquo;s lust for knowledge! The
thought restored his courage. More than life
itself depended upon his coolness and address;
he must act, at once. The monstrous possibility
hinted at by von Hohenheim&mdash;in his earliest published
work, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Practica D. Theophrasti Paracelsi</i>,
printed at Augsburg in 1529, was, in this hideous
pamphlet, elaborated and brought within the
bounds of practical experiment.</p>

<p>He crept to the door, opened it, and stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
listening intently. That silence which seemed
like a palpable cloud&mdash;a cloud masking the
presence of one who watched&mdash;lay over the house.
Slowly he descended to the hall and dropped the
horror which the evil genius of von Hohenheim
had conceived, upon the spot where it had lain
when his foot had discovered it.</p>

<p>A creaking sound warned him of some one&rsquo;s
approach, and he had barely time to slip behind
some draperies ere a cowled figure bearing a
lantern came out into the hall. It was Dr.
Kassimere, wearing a loose gown having a monkish
hood&mdash;and he was searching for something.</p>

<p>Nothing in his experience&mdash;not the blood-lust
seen in the eyes of men in battle&mdash;had prepared
him for that which transfigured the face of Dr.
Kassimere. The strange semblance of Thoth was
there no more; it had given place to another,
more active malevolence, to a sort of Satanic
<em>eagerness</em> indescribably terrifying; it was the
face of one possessed.</p>

<p>Like some bird of prey he pounced upon the
book, thrust it into the pocket of his gown, and
began furtively to retrace his steps. As he
entered the big dining-room, Dillon was close
upon his heels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Kassimere passed into the small room
beyond and turned from thence into the library.
Dillon, observing every precaution, followed.
From the library the doctor entered the short,
narrow passage leading to that quaint relic of
bygone days and ways&mdash;the tiny chapel. At the
entrance Dillon paused, watchful. Once, the
man in the monkish robe turned, on the time-worn
step of the altar, and looked back over his
shoulder, revealing a face that might well have
been that of Asmodeus himself.</p>

<p>On the left of the altar was the cupboard
wherein, no doubt, in past ages, the priest had
kept his vestments. The oppressive odour which
Dillon had first observed in the dining-room was
very perceptible in the chapel; and as Dr.
Kassimere opened the door of the cupboard and
stepped within, an explanation of the presence
of this deathly smell in the house occurred
to Dillon&rsquo;s mind. The laboratory adjoined the
Grange on this side; here was a private entrance
known to, and used by, Dr. Kassimere alone.</p>

<p>His surmise proved to be correct. Occasioning
scarcely a sound, the secret door opened, and
a fiery glow leapt out across the altar steps,
accompanied by a wave of heated air laden with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the nauseous, unnameable smell. Within the
redly lighted doorway, Dr. Kassimere paused, and
glanced at a watch which he wore upon his wrist.
Then for a moment he disappeared, to reappear
carrying a small squat bottle and a contrivance
of wire and gauze the sight of which created in
Dillon a sense of physical nausea. It was a
chloroform-mask! Both he placed upon a
vaguely seen table and again approached the door.</p>

<p>Weakly, Dillon fell back, pressing himself,
closely against the chapel wall, as the doctor,
this time leaving the secret entrance open&mdash;with
a purpose in view which the watcher shudderingly
recognized&mdash;recrossed the chapel and went off,
softly treading, in the direction of the library.</p>

<p>All his courage, moral and physical, was called
upon now, and knowing, by some intuition of
love, what and whom he should find there, he
stepped unsteadily into Dr. Kassimere&rsquo;s laboratory....</p>

<p>That there were horrors&mdash;monstrosities that
may not be described, whose names may not be
written&mdash;in the place, he realised, in some subconscious
fashion; but&mdash;prone upon a low, metal
couch of most curious workmanship lay Phryné,
in her night-robe, still&mdash;white; perfect in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
pale beauty as her namesake who posed for
Praxiteles.</p>

<p>Dillon reeled, steadied himself, and sank upon
his knees by the couch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phryné!&rdquo; he whispered, locking his arms
about her&mdash;&ldquo;my Phryné!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he remembered the gauze mask and even
detected the sickly, sweet smell of the anaesthetic.
Anger gave him new strength; he raised the girl
in his arms and turned towards the door communicating
with the chapel.</p>

<p>Framed in the opening was the hooded figure
of Dr. Kassimere, confronting him. His face
was immobile again, with the immobility of
ibis-headed Thoth; his eyes were hard, his voice
was cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this outrage?&rdquo; he
demanded sternly. &ldquo;Phryné has been taken
suddenly ill; an immediate operation may be
necessary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of my way!&rdquo; said Dillon, advancing
past a huge glass jar filled with reddish liquid
that stood upon a pedestal between the couch
and the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be careful, you fool!&rdquo; shrieked Dr. Kassimere,
frenziedly, his calm dropping from him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
like a cloak and a new and dreadful light coming
into the staring eyes.</p>

<p>But he was too late. Dillon&rsquo;s foot had caught
the pedestal. With a resounding crash the thing
overturned; as Dr. Kassimere sprang forward,
he slipped in the slimy stream that was pouring
over the laboratory floor&mdash;and fell....</p>

<p>Laying Phryné upon the altar, her head resting
against the age-worn communion rails, Dillon

<h2>The Curse of a Thousand Kisses</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Introductory</span></h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">Saville Grainger</span> will long be remembered
by the public as a brilliant journalist
and by his friends as a confirmed misogynist.
His distaste for the society of women amounted
to a mania, and to Grainger a pretty face was like
a red rag to a bull. This was all the more extraordinary
and, for Grainger, more painful, because
he was one of the most handsome men I ever
knew&mdash;very dark, with wonderful flashing eyes
and the features of an early Roman&mdash;or, as I have
since thought, of an aristocratic Oriental;
aquiline, clean-cut, and swarthy. At any mixed
gathering at which he appeared, women gravitated
in his direction as though he possessed
some magnetic attraction for the sex; and
Grainger invariably bolted.</p>

<p>His extraordinary end&mdash;never explained to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
day&mdash;will be remembered by some of those who
read of it; but so much that affected whole
continents has occurred in the interval that to
the majority of the public the circumstances will
no longer be familiar. It created a considerable
stir in Cairo at the time, as was only natural, but
when the missing man failed to return, the nine
days&rsquo; wonder of his disappearance was forgotten
in the excitement of some new story or another.</p>

<p>Briefly, Grainger, who was recuperating at
Mena House after a rather severe illness in London,
went out one evening for a stroll, wearing a
light dust-coat over his evening clothes and
smoking a cigarette. He turned in the direction
of the Great Pyramid&mdash;and never came back.
That is the story in its bald entirety. No one
has ever seen him since&mdash;or ever reported having
seen him.</p>

<p>If the following story is an elaborate hoax&mdash;perpetrated
by Grainger himself, for some obscure
reason remaining in hiding, or by another well
acquainted with his handwriting&mdash;I do not
profess to say. As to how it came into my possession,
that may be told very briefly. Two years
after Grainger&rsquo;s disappearance I was in Cairo,
and although I was not staying at Mena House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
I sometimes visited friends there. One night as
I came out of the hotel to enter the car which was
to drive me back to the Continental, a tall native,
dressed in white and so muffled up that little
more of his face than two gleaming eyes was
visible, handed me a packet&mdash;a roll of paper,
apparently&mdash;saluted me with extraordinary formality,
and departed.</p>

<p>No one else seemed to have noticed the man,
although the chauffeur, of course, was nearly
as close to him as I was, and a servant from the
hotel had followed me out and down the steps.
I stood there in the dusk, staring at the packet
in my hand and then after the tall figure&mdash;already
swallowed up in the shadow of the road.
Naturally I assumed that the man had made some
mistake, and holding the package near the lamp
of the car I examined it closely.</p>

<p>It was a roll of some kind of parchment, tied
with a fragment of thin string, and upon the
otherwise blank outside page my name was
written very distinctly!</p>

<p>I entered the car, rather dazed by the occurrence,
which presented several extraordinary
features, and, unfastening the string, began to
read. Then, in real earnest, I thought I must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
dreaming. Since I append the whole of the
manuscript I will make no further reference to the
contents here, but will content myself with
mentioning that it was written&mdash;with dark-brown
ink&mdash;in Saville Grainger&rsquo;s unmistakable hand
upon some kind of parchment or papyrus which
has defied three different experts to whom I have
shown it, but which, in short, is of unknown
manufacture. The twine with which it was tied
proved to be of finely plaited reed.</p>

<p>That part of Grainger&rsquo;s narrative, if the following
amazing statement is really the work of
Grainger, which deals with events up to the time
that he left Mena House&mdash;and the world&mdash;I have
been able to check. The dragoman, Hassan
Abd-el-Kebîr, was still practising his profession
at Mena House at the time of my visit, and he
confirmed the truth of Grainger&rsquo;s story in regard
to the heart of lapis-lazuli, which he had seen,
and the meeting with the old woman in the
Mûski&mdash;of which Grainger had spoken to him.</p>

<p>For the rest, the manuscript shall tell Grainger&rsquo;s
story.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Manuscript</span></h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Two years have elapsed since I quitted the
world, and the presence in Egypt of a one-time
colleague, of which I have been advised, prompts
me to put on record these particulars of the
strangest, most wonderful, and most beautiful
experience which has ever befallen any man.
I do not expect my story to be believed. The
scepticism of the material world of Fleet Street
will consume my statement with its devouring
fires. But I do not care. The old itching to
make a &ldquo;story&rdquo; is upon me. As a &ldquo;story&rdquo;
let this paper be regarded.</p>

<p>Where the experience actually began I must
leave to each reader to judge for himself. I,
personally, do not profess to know, even now.
But the curtain first arose upon that part of the
story which it is my present purpose to chronicle
one afternoon near the corner of the Street of the
Silversmiths in Cairo. I was wandering in those
wonderful narrow, winding lanes, unaccompanied,
for I am by habit a solitary being; and
despite my ignorance of the language and customs
of the natives I awakened to the fact that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
link of sympathy&mdash;of silent understanding&mdash;seemed
to bind me to these busy brown men.</p>

<p>I had for many years cherished a secret ambition
to pay a protracted visit to Egypt, but the
ties of an arduous profession hitherto had rendered
its realisation impossible. Now, a stranger
in a strange land, I found myself <em>at home</em>. I
cannot hope to make evident to my readers the
completeness of this recognition. From Shepheard&rsquo;s,
with its throngs of cosmopolitan travellers
and its hosts of pretty women, I had early fled
in dismay to the comparative quiet of Mena
House. But the only real happiness I ever
knew&mdash;indeed, as I soon began to realise, had
ever known&mdash;I found among the discordant
cries and mingled smells of perfume and decay
in the native city. The desert called to me
sweetly, but it was the people, the shops, the
shuttered houses, the noise and the smells of the
Eastern streets which gripped my heart.</p>

<p>Delightedly I watched the passage of those
commercial vehicles, narrow and set high upon
monstrous wheels, which convey loads of indescribable
variety along streets no wider than the
&ldquo;hall&rdquo; of a small suburban residence. The
Parsees in the Khân Khalîl with their carpets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and shining silk-ware, the Arab dealers, fierce
swarthy tradesmen from the desert, and the
smooth-tongued Cairenes upholding embroidered
cloths and gauzy <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">yashmaks</i> to allure the eye&mdash;all
these I watched with a kind of gladness that was
almost tender, that was unlike any sentiment I
had ever experienced toward my fellow-creatures
before.</p>

<p>Mendicants crying the eternal &ldquo;<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Bakshîsh!</i>&rdquo;,
<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Sakhas</i> with their skins of Nile water, and the
other hundred and one familiar figures of the
quarter filled me with a great and glad contentment.</p>

<p>I purposely haunted the Mûski during the heat
of the day because at that hour it was comparatively
free from the presence of Europeans
and Americans. Thus, on the occasion of which
I write, coming to the end of the street in which
the shops of the principal silversmiths are situated,
I found myself to be the only white man (if I
except the Greeks) in the immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<p>A group of men hurrying out of the street as I
approached it first attracted my attention. They
were glancing behind them apprehensively as
though at a rabid dog. Then came a white-bearded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
man riding a tiny donkey and also
glancing back apprehensively over his shoulder.
He all but collided with me in his blind haste;
and, stepping quickly aside to avoid him, I knocked
down an old woman who was coming out of the
street.</p>

<p>The man who had been the real cause of the
accident rode off at headlong speed and I found
myself left with the poor victim of my clumsiness
in a spot which seemed miraculously to have
become deserted. If the shopkeepers remained
in their shops, they were invisible, and must have
retreated into the darkest corners of the caves
in the wall which constitute native emporiums.
Pedestrians there were none.</p>

<p>I stooped to the old woman, who lay moaning
at my feet ... and as I did so, I shrank. How
can I describe the loathing, the repulsion which
I experienced? Never in the whole of my
career had I seen such a hideous face. A ragged
black veil which she wore had been torn from its
brass fastenings as she fell, and her countenance
was revealed in all its appalling ugliness. Yellow,
shrivelled, toothless, it was scarcely human;
but, above all, it repelled because of its aspect
of <em>extreme age</em>. I do not mean that it was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the face of a woman of eighty; it was like that
of a woman who had miraculously survived
decease for several centuries! It was a witch-face,
a deathly face.</p>

<p>And as I shrank, she opened her eyes, moaning
feebly, and groping with claw-like hands as if
darkness surrounded her. Furthermore I saw a
new pain, and a keener pain, light up those aged
eyes. She had detected my involuntary movement
of loathing.</p>

<p>Those who knew me will bear testimony to the
fact that I was not an emotional man or one
readily impressionable by any kind of human
appeal. Therefore they will wonder the more to
learn that this pathetic light in the old woman&rsquo;s
eyes changed my revulsion to a poignant sorrow.
I had roughly knocked her from her feet and now
hesitated to assist her to rise again! Truly, she
was scorned and rejected by all. A wave of
tenderness, that cannot be described, that could
not be resisted, swept over me. My eyes grew
misty and a great remorse claimed me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old soul!&rdquo; I whispered.</p>

<p>Stooping, I gently raised the shrivelled, ape-like
head, resting it against my knee; and, bending
down, I kissed the old woman on the brow!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>I record the fact, but even now, looking back
upon its happening, and seeking to recapture the
cold, solitary Saville Grainger who has left the
world, I realise the wonder of it. That <em>I</em> should
have given rein to such an impulse! That such
an impulse should have stirred me! Which
phenomenon was the more remarkable?</p>

<p>The result of my act&mdash;regretted as soon as
performed&mdash;was singular. The aged, hideous
creature sighed in a manner I can never forget,
and an expression that almost lent comeliness to
her features momentarily crept over her face.
Then she rose to her feet with difficulty, raised
her hands as if blessing me, and muttering something
in Arabic went shuffling along the deserted
street, stooping as she walked.</p>

<p>Apparently the episode had passed unnoticed.
Certainly if anyone witnessed it he was well
concealed. But, conscious of a strange embarrassment,
with which were mingled other tumultuous
emotions, I turned out of the Street of the
Silversmiths and found myself amid the normal
activities of the quarter again. The memory of
the Kiss was repugnant, I wanted to wipe my
lips&mdash;but something seemed to forbid the act; a
lingering compassion that was almost a yearning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>For once in my life I desired to find myself
among normal, healthy, moderately brainless
Europeans. I longed for the smell of cigar-smoke,
for the rattle of the cocktail-maker and
the sight of a pretty face. I hurried to Shepheard&rsquo;s.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>The same night, after dinner, I walked out of
Mena House to look for Hassan Abd-el-Kebîr,
the dragoman with whom I had contracted for a
journey, by camel, to Sakhâra on the following
day. He had promised to attend at half-past
eight in order to arrange the time of starting in
the morning, together with some other details.</p>

<p>I failed to find him, however, among the dragomans
and other natives seated outside the hotel,
and to kill time I strolled leisurely down the road
toward the electric-tram terminus. I had taken
no more than ten paces, I suppose, when a tall
native, muffled to the tip of his nose in white
and wearing a white turban, appeared out of the
darkness beside me, thrust a small package into
my hand, and, touching his brow, his lips and his
breast with both hands, bowed and departed.
I saw him no more!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Standing there in the road, I stared at the
little package stupidly. It consisted of a piece
of fine white silk fastened about some small,
hard object. Evidently, I thought, there had
been a mistake. The package could not have
been intended for me.</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel, I stood near a lamp and
unfastened the silk, which was delicately perfumed.
It contained a piece of lapis-lazuli
carved in the form of a heart, beautifully mounted
in gold and bearing three Arabic letters, inlaid
in some way, also in gold!</p>

<p>At this singular ornament I stared harder than
ever. Certainly the muffled native had made a
strange mistake. This was a love-token&mdash;and
emphatically not for <em>me</em>!</p>

<p>I was standing there lost in wonderment, the
heart of lapis-lazuli in my palm, when the voice
of Hassan disturbed my stupor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my gentleman, I am sorry to be late
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice ceased. I looked up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>Then I, too, said no more. Hassan Abd-el-Kebîr
was glaring at the ornament in my hand
as though I had held, not a very choice example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
of native jewellery, but an adder or a scorpion!</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked, recovering
from my surprise. &ldquo;Do you know to whom this
amulet belongs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He muttered something in guttural Arabic
ere replying to my question. Then:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the heart of lapis,&rdquo; he said, in a strange
voice. &ldquo;It is the heart of lapis!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much is evident,&rdquo; I cried, laughing.
&ldquo;But does it alarm you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; he said softly, and held out a brown
hand&mdash;&ldquo;I will see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I placed the thing in his open palm and he
gazed at it as one might imagine an orchid hunter
would gaze at a new species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Odontoglossum</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do the figures mean?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They form the word <em>alf</em>,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Alf?</em> Somebody&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; I said, still
laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Arab it mean ten hundred,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thousand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;one thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hassan returned the ornament to me, and his
expression was so strange that I began to grow
really annoyed. He was looking at me with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
mingling of envy and compassion which I found
to be quite insufferable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hassan,&rdquo; I said sternly, &ldquo;you will tell me
all you know about this matter. One would
imagine that you suspected me of stealing the
thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, no, my gentleman!&rdquo; he protested
earnestly. &ldquo;But I will tell you, yes, only you
will not believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Hassan Abd-el-Kebîr told me the
most improbable story to which I had ever
listened. Since to reproduce it in his imperfect
English, with my own frequent interjections,
would be tedious, I will give it in brief. Some
of the historical details, imperfectly related by
Hassan as I learned later, I have corrected.</p>

<p>In the reign of the Khalîf El-Mamûn&mdash;a son of
Hárûn er-Rashîd and brother of the prototype
of Beckford&rsquo;s <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Vathek</i>&mdash;one Shâwar was Governor
of Egypt, and the daughter of the Governor,
Scheherazade, was famed throughout the domains
of the Khalîf as the most beautiful maiden in the
land. Wazîrs and princes sought her hand in
vain. Her heart was given to a handsome young
merchant of Cairo, Ahmad er-Mâdi, who was also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the wealthiest man in the city. Shâwar, although
an indulgent father, would not hear of such a
union, however, but he hesitated to destroy his
daughter&rsquo;s happiness by forcing her into an
unwelcome marriage. Finally, passion conquered
reason in the breasts of the lovers and they fled,
Scheherazade escaping from the palace of her
father by means of a rope-ladder smuggled into
the <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">harêm</i> apartments by a slave whom Ahmad&rsquo;s
gold had tempted, and meeting Ahmad outside
the gardens where he waited with a fleet horse.</p>

<p>Even the guard at the city gate had been
bought by the wealthy merchant, and the pair
succeeded in escaping from Cairo.</p>

<p>The extensive possessions of Ahmad were confiscated
by the enraged father and a sentence of
death was passed upon the absent man&mdash;to be
instantly put into execution in the event of his
arrest anywhere within the domain of the Khalîf.</p>

<p>Exiled in a distant oasis, the Sheikh of which
was bound to Ahmad by ties of ancient friendship,
the prospect which had seemed so alluring to
Scheherazade became clouded. Recognising this
change in her attitude, Ahmad er-Mâdi racked
his brains for some scheme whereby he might
recover his lost wealth and surround his beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
wife with the luxury to which she had been
accustomed. In this extremity he had recourse
to a certain recluse who resided in a solitary
spot in the desert far from the haunts of men and
who was widely credited with magical powers.</p>

<p>It was a whole week&rsquo;s journey to the abode of
the wizard, and, unknown to Ahmad, during his
absence a son of the Khalîf, visiting Egypt,
chanced to lose his way on a hunting expedition,
and came upon the secret oasis in which Scheherazade
was hiding. This prince had been one
of her most persistent suitors.</p>

<p>The ancient magician consented to receive
Ahmad, and the first boon which the enamoured
young man craved of him was that he might
grant him a sight of Scheherazade. The student
of dark arts consented. Bidding Ahmad to look
into a mirror, he burned the secret perfumes and
uttered the prescribed incantation. At first
mistily, and then quite clearly, Ahmad saw
Scheherazade, standing in the moonlight beneath
a tall palm tree&mdash;her lips raised to those of her
former suitor!</p>

<p>At that the world grew black before the eyes of
Ahmad. And he, who had come a long and
arduous journey at the behest of love, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
experienced an equally passionate hatred. Acquainting
the magician with what he had seen, he
demanded that he should exercise his art in
visiting upon the false Scheherazade the most
terrible curse that it lay within his power to
invoke!</p>

<p>The learned man refused; whereupon Ahmad,
insane with sorrow and anger, drew his sword and
gave the magician choice of compliance or instant
death. The threat sufficed. The wizard performed
a ghastly conjuration, calling down upon
Scheherazade the curse of an ugliness beyond
that of humanity, and which should remain with
her not for the ordinary span of a lifetime but for
incalculable years, during which she should
continue to live in the flesh, loathed, despised,
and shunned of all!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Until one thousand compassionate men,
unasked and of their own free will, shall each have
bestowed a kiss upon thee,&rdquo; was the exact text
of the curse. &ldquo;Then thou shalt regain thy beauty,
thy love&mdash;and death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ahmad er-Mâdi staggered out from the cavern,
blinded by a hundred emotions&mdash;already sick
with remorse; and one night&rsquo;s stage on his return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>journey dropped dead from his saddle ...
stricken by the malignant will of the awful being
whose power he had invoked! I will conclude
this wild romance in the words of Hassan, the
dragoman, as nearly as I can recall them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he said, his voice lowered in awe,
&ldquo;Scheherazade, who was stricken with age and
ugliness in the very hour that the curse was
spoken, went out into the world, my gentleman.
She begged her way from place to place, and as
the years passed by accumulated much wealth
in that manner. Finally, it is said, she returned
to Cairo, her native city, and there remained.
To each man who bestowed a kiss upon her&mdash;and
such men were rare&mdash;she caused a heart of
lapis to be sent, and upon the heart was engraved
in gold the number of the kiss! It is said that
these gifts ensured to those upon whom they were
bestowed the certain possession of their beloved!
Once before, when I was a small child, I saw such
an amulet, and the number upon it was nine
hundred and ninety-nine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thing was utterly incredible, of course;
merely a picturesque example of Eastern imagination;
but just to see what effect it would have
upon him, I told Hassan about the old woman in
the Mûski. I had to do so. Frankly, the coincidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was so extraordinary that it worried me.
When I had finished:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was she&mdash;Scheherazade,&rdquo; he said fearfully.
&ldquo;And it was the <em>last</em> kiss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my gentleman. I do not know!&rdquo;</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Throughout the expedition to Sakhâra on the
following day I could not fail to note that Hassan
was covertly watching me&mdash;and his expression
annoyed me intensely. It was that compound
of compassion and resignation which one might
bestow upon a condemned man.</p>

<p>I charged him with it, but of course he denied
any such sentiment. Nevertheless, I knew that
he entertained it, and, what was worse, I began, in
an uncomfortable degree, to share it with him!
I cannot make myself clearer. But I simply
felt the normal world to be slipping from under
my feet, and, no longer experiencing a desire to
clutch at modernity as I had done after my
meeting with the old woman, I found myself to
be reconciled to my fate!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>To my fate? ... to what fate? I did not
know; but I realised, beyond any shade of
doubt, that something tremendous, inevitable,
and ultimate was about to happen to me. I
caught myself unconsciously raising the heart of
lapis-lazuli to my lips! Why I did so I had no
idea; I seemed to have lost identity. I no
longer knew myself.</p>

<p>When Hassan parted from me at Mena House
that evening he could not disguise the fact that
he regarded the parting as final; yet my plans
were made for several weeks ahead. Nor did I
quarrel with the man&rsquo;s curious attitude. <em>I</em>
regarded the parting as final, also!</p>

<p>In a word I was becoming reconciled&mdash;to something.
It is difficult, all but impossible, to render
such a frame of mind comprehensible, and I shall
not even attempt the task, but leave the events
of the night to speak for themselves.</p>

<p>After dinner I lighted a cigarette, and avoiding
a particularly persistent and very pretty widow
who was waiting to waylay me in the lounge, I
came out of the hotel and strolled along in the
direction of the Pyramid. Once I looked back&mdash;bidding
a silent farewell to Mena House! Then I
took out the heart of lapis-lazuli from my pocket
and kissed it rapturously&mdash;kissed it as I had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
kissed any object or any person in the whole
course of my life!</p>

<p>And why I did so I had no idea.</p>

<p>All who read my story will be prepared to
learn that in this placid and apparently feeble
frame of mind I slipped from life, from the
world. It was not so. The modern man, the
Saville Grainger once known in Fleet Street,
came to life again for one terrible, strenuous
moment ... and then passed out of life for
ever.</p>

<p>Just before I reached the Pyramid, and at a
lonely spot in the path&mdash;for this was not a
&ldquo;Sphinx and Pyramid night&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, the
moon was not at the full&mdash;a tall, muffled native
appeared at my elbow. He was the same man
who had brought me the heart of lapis-lazuli, or
his double. I started.</p>

<p>He touched me lightly on the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and pointed ahead into the
darkness below the plateau.</p>

<p>I moved off obediently. Then&mdash;suddenly,
swiftly, came revolt. The modern man within
me flared into angry life. I stopped dead, and</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you? Where are you leading me?&rdquo;
I cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>I received no reply.</p>

<p>A silk scarf was slipped over my head by
some one who, silently, must have been following
me, and drawn tight enough to prevent any loud
outcry but not so as to endanger my breathing.
I fought like a madman. I knew, and the knowledge
appalled me, that I was fighting for life.
Arms like bands of steel grasped me; I was
lifted, bound and carried&mdash;I knew not where....</p>

<p>Placed in some kind of softly padded saddle, or,
as I have since learned, into a <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">shibrîyeh</i> or covered
litter on a camel&rsquo;s back, I felt the animal rise to
its ungainly height and move off swiftly. As
suddenly as revolt had flamed up, resignation
returned. I was contented. My bonds were unnecessary;
my rebellion was ended. I yearned,
wildly, for the end of the desert journey! Some
one was calling me and all my soul replied.</p>

<p>For hours, as it seemed, the camel raced ceaselessly
on. Absolute silence reigned about me.
Then, in the distance I heard voices, and the gait
of the camel changed. Finally the animal stood
still. Came a word of guttural command, and
the camel dropped to its knees. Pillowed among
a pile of scented cushions, I experienced no
discomfort from this usually painful operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>I was lifted out of my perfumed couch and set
upon my feet. Having been allowed to stand for
a while until the effects of remaining so long in a
constrained position had worn off, I was led forward
into some extensive building. Marble
pavements were beneath my feet, fountains
played, and the air was heavy with burning
ambergris.</p>

<p>I was placed with my back to a pillar and
bound there, but not harshly. The bandage
about my head was removed. I stared around me.</p>

<p>A magnificent Eastern apartment met my gaze&mdash;a
great hall open on one side to the desert.
Out upon the sands I could see a group of men
who had evidently been my captors and my
guards. The one who had unfastened the silk
scarf I could not see, but I heard him moving
away behind the pillar to which I was bound.</p>

<p>Stretched upon a luxurious couch before me
was a woman.</p>

<p>If I were to seek to describe her I should
inevitably fail, for her loveliness surpassed everything
which I had ever beheld&mdash;of which I had
ever dreamed. I found myself looking into her
eyes, and in their depths I found all that I had
missed in life, and lost all that I had found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>She smiled, rose, and taking a jewelled dagger
from a little table beside her, approached me.
My heart beat until I felt almost suffocated as she
came near. And when she bent and cut the
silken lashing which bound me, I knew such
rapture as I had hitherto counted an invention
of Arabian poets. I was raised above the joys
of common humanity and tasted the joy of the
gods. She placed the dagger in my hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My life is thine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And clutching at the silken raiment draping her
beautiful bosom, she invited me to plunge the
blade into her heart!</p>

<p>The knife dropped, clattering upon the marble
pavement. For one instant I hesitated, watching
her, devouring her with my eyes; then I swept
her to me and pressed upon her sweet lips the
thousand and first kiss....</p>

<h2>The Turquoise Necklace</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p class="cap"><span class="upper">&ldquo;He</span> is the lord of the desert, Effendi,&rdquo;
declared Mohammed the dragoman.
&ldquo;From the Valley of Zered to Damascus he is
known and loved, but feared. They say&rdquo;&mdash;he
lowered his voice&mdash;&ldquo;that he is a great <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">welee</i>, and
that he is often seen in the street of the attars,
having the appearance of a simple old man;
but in the desert he is like a bitter apple, a viper
and a calamity! Overlord is he of the Bedouins,
and all the sons of the desert bow to Ben Azreem,
Sheikh of the Ibn-Rawallah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is a <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">welee</i>, exactly?&rdquo; asked Graham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man of God, Effendi, favoured beyond
other men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this Arab Sheikh is a <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">welee</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it is said. He goes about secretly aiding
the poor and afflicted, when he may be known
by his white beard&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There are many white beards in Egypt,&rdquo; said
Graham.</p>

<p>But the other continued, ignoring the interruption:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in the desert, Ben Azreem, a horseman
unrivalled, may be known by the snow-white
horse which he rides, or if he is not so mounted,
by his white camel, swifter than the glance of
envy, more surefooted than the eager lover who
climbs to his enslaver&rsquo;s window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Graham dryly. &ldquo;Well, I
hope I may have the pleasure of meeting this
mysterious notability before I leave the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless you journey across the sands for many
days, it is unlikely. For when he comes into
Egypt he reveals himself to none but the
supremely good,&rdquo;&mdash;Graham stared&mdash;&ldquo;and the
supremely wicked!&rdquo; added Mohammed.</p>

<p>The poetic dragoman having departed, Graham
leaned over to his wife, who had sat spellbound,
her big blue eyes turned to the face of Mohammed
throughout his romantic narrative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These wild native legends appeal to you,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he said, smiling and patting her
hand affectionately. &ldquo;You superstitious little
colleen!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Eileen Graham blushed, and the blush of a
pretty Irish bride is a very beautiful thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it at all, then?&rdquo; she asked
softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe there may be such a person as Ben
Azreem, and possibly he&rsquo;s a very imposing individual.
He may even indulge in visits, incognito,
to Cairo, in the manner of the late lamented
Hárûn er-Rashîd of <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> memory, but
I can&rsquo;t say that I believe in <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">welees</i> as a class!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife shrugged her pretty shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something that <em>I</em> have to tell you,
which I suppose you will also refuse to believe,&rdquo;
she said, with mock indignation. &ldquo;You remember
the Arabs whom we saw at the exhibition
in London?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graham started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentlemen who were advertised as
&lsquo;chiefs from the Arabian Desert&rsquo;? I remember
<em>one</em> in particular.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the one I mean,&rdquo; said Eileen.</p>

<p>Her husband looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your explanation is delightfully lucid, dear!&rdquo;
he said jocularly. &ldquo;My memories of the gentleman
known as El-Suleym, I believe, are not
pleasant; his memories of me must be equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
unfavourable. He illustrated the fact that savages
should never be introduced into civilised
society, however fascinating they may be personally.
Mrs. Marstham was silly enough to
take the man up, and because of the way he
looked at you, I was wise enough to knock him
down! What then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only this&mdash;I saw him, to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eileen!&rdquo; There was alarm in Graham&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;Where? Here, or in Cairo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we were driving away from the mosque
of the Whirling Dervishes. He was one of a
group who stood by the bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are certain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite certain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say. He gave no sign to show
that he had seen me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Graham lighted a cigarette with much
care.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, anyway,&rdquo; he said, carelessly.
&ldquo;You are as safe here as at the <i>Ritz</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was unrest in the glance which he
cast out across the prospect touched by moon-magic
into supernatural beauty.</p>

<p>In the distance gleamed a fairy city of silvern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
minarets, born, it seemed, from the silvern stream.
Beyond lay the night mystery of the desert, into
whose vastness marched the ghostly acacias.
The discordant chattering and chanting from the
river-bank merged into a humming song, not
unmusical. The howling of the dogs, even, found
a place in the orchestral scheme.</p>

<p>Behind him, in the hotel, was European and
American life&mdash;modernity; before him was that
other life, endless and unchanging. There was
something cold, sombre, and bleak in the wonderful
prospect, something shocking in the presence
of those sight-seeing, careless folk, the luxurious
hotel, <em>all</em> that was Western and new, upon that
threshold of the ancient, changeless desert.</p>

<p>A menace, too, substantial yet cloaked with
the mystery of the motherland of mysteries, had
arisen now. Although he had assured Eileen
that Gizeh was as safe as Piccadilly, he had too
much imagination to be unaware that from the
Egypt of Cook&rsquo;s to the Egypt of secrets is but a
step.</p>

<p>None but the very young or very sanguine
traveller looks for adventure nowadays in the
neighbourhood of Mena House. When the intrepid
George Sandys visited and explored the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Great Pyramid, it was at peril of his life, but
Graham reflected humorously that the most
nervous old ladies now performed the feat almost
daily. Yet out here in the moonlight where the
silence was, out beyond the radius of &ldquo;sights,&rdquo;
lay a land unknown to Europe, as every desert
is unknown.</p>

<p>It was a thought that had often come to him,
but it came to-night with a force and wearing a
significance which changed the aspect of the
sands, the aspect of all Egypt.</p>

<p>He glanced at the charming girl beside him.
Eileen, too, was looking into the distance with
far-away gaze. The pose of her head was delightful,
and he sat watching her in silence. Within
the hotel the orchestra had commenced softly
to play; but Graham did not notice the fact.
He was thinking how easily one could be lost out
upon that grey ocean, with its islands of priestly
ruins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is growing rather chilly, dear,&rdquo; he said
suddenly; &ldquo;even for fur wraps. Suppose we
go in?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The crowd in the bazaar was excessive, and
the bent old figure which laboured beneath a
nondescript burden, wrapped up in a blue cloth,
passed from the noisiness out into the narrow
street which ran at right-angles with the lane of
many shops.</p>

<p>Perhaps the old Arab was deaf, perhaps wearied
to the point of exhaustion; but, from whatever
cause, he ignored, or was unaware of, the oncoming
<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">arabeeyeh</i>, whose driver had lost control
of his horse. Even the shrill scream of the corpulent,
white-veiled German lady, who was one
of its passengers, failed to arouse him. Out
into the narrow roadway he staggered, bent almost
double.</p>

<p>Graham, accompanied by Mohammed, was
some distance away, haggling with a Greek thief
who held the view that a return of three hundred
and fifty per cent. spelled black ruination.</p>

<p>Eileen, finding the air stifling, had walked on
in the direction of the less crowded street above.
Thus it happened that she, and the poor old
porter, alone, were in the path of the onward-whirling
carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Many women so placed would have stood,
frozen with horror, have been struck down by
the frantic animal; some would have had sufficient
presence of mind to gain the only shelter
attainable in time&mdash;that of a deep-set doorway.
Few would have acted as Eileen acted.</p>

<p>It was under the stimulus of that Celtic
impetuosity&mdash;that generous madness which seems
to proceed, not from the mind, but from the heart&mdash;that
she leapt, not back, but forward.</p>

<p>She never knew exactly what took place, nor
how she escaped destruction; but there was a
roaring in her ears, above it rising the Teutonic
screams of the lady in the <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">arabeeyeh</i>; there
was a confused chorus of voices, a consciousness
of effort; and she found herself, with wildly
beating heart, crouching back into the recess
which once had held a <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">mastabah</i>.</p>

<p>From some place invisible, around a bend in
the tortuous street, came sounds of shouting and
that of lashing hoofs. The runaway was stopped.
At her feet lay a shapeless bundle wrapped in a
blue cloth, and beside her, leaning back against
the whitewashed wall, and breathing with short,
sobbing breaths, was the old porter.</p>

<p>Now, her husband had his arms about her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Mohammed, with frightened eyes, hovered in
the background. Without undue haste, all the
bazaar gradually was coming upon the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My darling, are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Graham&rsquo;s voice shook. He was deathly
pale.</p>

<p>Eileen smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, dear,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;But
I am afraid the poor old man is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite sure you are not hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not so much as touched, though honestly
I don&rsquo;t know how either of us escaped. But do
see if the old man is injured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graham turned to the rescued porter, who now
had recovered his composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mohammed, ask him if he is hurt,&rdquo; he directed.</p>

<p>Mohammed put the question. A curious group
surrounded the party. But the old man, ignoring
all, knelt and bowed his bare head to the
dust at Eileen&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, John,&rdquo; cried the girl, &ldquo;ask him to stand
up! I feel ashamed to see such a venerable
old man kneeling before me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him it is&mdash;nothing,&rdquo; said Graham hastily
to Mohammed, &ldquo;and&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;&mdash;he fumbled
in his pocket&mdash;&ldquo;give him this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mohammed, looking ill at ease, thrust
aside the proffered <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">bakshîsh</i>&mdash;a novel action
which made Graham stare widely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would not take it, Effendi,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;See, his turban lies there; he is a <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">hadj</i>. He
is praying for the eternal happiness of his preserver,
and he is interceding with the Prophet
(<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Salla&mdash;&rsquo;lláhu &rsquo;aleyhi wasellum</i>), that she may
enjoy the delights of Paradise equally with all
true Believers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good of him,&rdquo; said Graham, who, finding
the danger passed and his wife safe, was
beginning to feel embarrassed. &ldquo;Thank him,
and tell him that she is greatly indebted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took Eileen&rsquo;s arm, and turned to force a
way through the strangely silent group about.
But the aged porter seized the hem of the girl&rsquo;s
white skirt, gently detaining her. As he rose
upon his knees, Mohammed, with marks of
unusual deference, handed him his green turban.
The old man, still clutching Eileen&rsquo;s dress, signed
that his dirty bundle should likewise be passed
to him. This was done.</p>

<p>Graham was impatient to get away. But&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humour him for a moment, dear,&rdquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Eileen softly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to hurt the
poor old fellow&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Into the bundle the old man plunged his hand,
and drew out a thin gold chain upon which hung
a queerly cut turquoise. He stood upright,
raised the piece of jewellery to his forehead and
to his lips, and held it out, the chain stretched
across his open palms, to Eileen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must be some kind of pedlar,&rdquo; said
Graham.</p>

<p>Eileen shook her head, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mohammed, tell him that I cannot possibly
take his chain,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;But thank him
all the same, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mohammed, his face averted from the statuesque
old figure, bent to her ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Take it! Do
not refuse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sort of frightened urgency in his
tones, so that both Graham and his wife looked
at him curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it, then, Eileen,&rdquo; said Graham quickly.
&ldquo;And, Mohammed, you must find out who he is,
and we will make it up to him in some way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Effendi,&rdquo; agreed the man readily.</p>

<p>Eileen accordingly accepted the present, glancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
aside at her husband to intimate that they
must not fail to pay for it. As she took the
chain in her hands, the donor said something
in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang it round your neck,&rdquo; translated Mohammed.</p>

<p>Eileen did so, whispering:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not lose sight of him, Mohammed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mohammed nodded; and the old man, replacing
his turban and making a low obeisance,
spoke rapidly a few words, took up his bundle,
and departed. The silent bystanders made way
for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Graham; &ldquo;I am anxious to
get out of this. Find a carriage, Mohammed.
We&rsquo;ll lunch at Shepheard&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A carriage was obtained, and they soon left far
behind them the scene of this odd adventure.
With Mohammed perched up on the box, Graham
and his wife could discuss the episode without
restraint. Graham, however, did most of the
talking, for Eileen was strangely silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is quite a fine stone,&rdquo; he said, examining
the necklace so curiously acquired. &ldquo;We must
find some way of repaying the old chap which will
not offend his susceptibilities.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Eileen nodded absently; and her husband, with
his eyes upon the dainty white figure, found gratitude
for her safety welling up like a hot spring in
his heart. The action had been characteristic;
and he longed to reprove her for risking her life,
yet burned to take her in his arms for the noble
impulse that had prompted her to do so.</p>

<p>He wondered anxiously if her silence could
be due to the after-effects of that moment of
intense excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel unwell, darling?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

<p>She smiled at him radiantly, and gave his hand
a quick little squeeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>But she remained silent to the end of the short
drive. This was not due to that which her husband
feared, however, but to the fact that she
had caught a glimpse, amongst the throng at the
corner of the bazaar, of the handsome, sinister
face of El-Suleym, the Bedouin.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>The moon poured radiance on the desert. At
the entrance to a camel-hair tent stood a tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
handsome man, arrayed in the picturesque costume
of the Bedouin. The tent behind him was
upheld by six poles. The ends and one side were
pegged to the ground, and the whole of that side
before which he stood was quite open, with the
exception of a portion before which hung a goat-hair
curtain.</p>

<p>This was the &ldquo;house of hair&rdquo; of the Sheikh
El-Suleym, of the Masr-Bishareen&mdash;El-Suleym,
&ldquo;the Regicide&rdquo; outcast of the great tribe of
the Bishareen. At some distance from the
Sheikh&rsquo;s tent were some half a dozen other and
smaller tents, housing the rascally following
of this desert outcast.</p>

<p>Little did those who had engaged the picturesque
El-Suleym, to display his marvellous
horsemanship in London, know that he and those
that came with him were a scorn among true
sons of the desert, pariahs of that brotherhood
which extends from Zered to the Nile, from Tanta
to the Red Sea; little did those who had opened
their doors in hospitality to the dashing horseman
dream that they entertained a petty brigand,
sought for by the Egyptian authorities, driven
out into ostracism by his own people.</p>

<p>And now before his tent he stood statuesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in the Egyptian moonlight, and looked towards
Gizeh, less than thirty miles to the north-east.</p>

<p>As El-Suleym looked towards Gizeh, Graham
and his wife were seated before Mena House
looking out across the desert. The adventure
of the morning had left its impression upon
both of them, and Eileen wore the gold chain
with its turquoise pendant. Graham was smoking
in silence, and thinking, not of the old porter
and his odd Eastern gratitude, but of another
figure, and one which often came between his
mental eye and the beauties of that old, beautiful
land. Eileen, too, was thinking of El-Suleym;
for the Bedouin now was associated in her mind
with the old pedlar, since she had last seen the
handsome, sinister face amid the throng at the
entrance to the bazaar.</p>

<p>Telepathy is a curious fact. Were Graham&rsquo;s
reflections <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en rapport</i> with his wife&rsquo;s, or were they
both influenced by the passionate thoughts of
that other mind, that subtle, cunning mind of
the man who at that moment was standing before
his house of hair and seeking with his eagle
glance to defy distance and the night?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you seen&mdash;him, again?&rdquo; asked Graham
abruptly. &ldquo;Since the other day at the bridge?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Eileen started. Although he had endeavoured
to hide it from her, she was perfectly well aware
of her husband&rsquo;s intense anxiety on her behalf.
She knew, although he prided himself upon having
masked his feelings, that the presence of
the Bedouin in Egypt had cast a cloud upon his
happiness. Therefore she had not wished to
tell him of her second encounter with El-Suleym.
But to this direct question there could be only
one reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw him again&mdash;this morning,&rdquo; she said,
toying nervously with the pendant at her neck.</p>

<p>Graham clasped her hand tensely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Outside the bazaar, in the crowd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not&mdash;tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not want to worry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t worry me, Eileen,&rdquo; he said carelessly.
&ldquo;If I were in Damascus or Aleppo, it
certainly might worry me to know that a man,
no doubt actively malignant towards us, was
near, perhaps watching; but Cairo is really a
prosaically safe and law-abiding spot. We are
as secure here as we should be at&mdash;Shepherd&rsquo;s
Bush, say!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>He laughed shortly. Voices floated out to
them, nasal, guttural, strident; voices American,
Teutonic, Gallic, and Anglo-Saxon. The orchestra
played a Viennese waltz. Confused chattering,
creaking, and bumping sounded from the river.
Out upon the mud walls dogs bayed the moon.</p>

<p>But beyond the native village, beyond the
howling dogs, beyond the acacia ranks out in
the silver-grey mystery of the sands hard by,
an outpost of the Pharaohs, where a ruined
shrine of Horus bared its secret places to the
peeping moon, the Sheikh of the Masr-Bishareen
smiled.</p>

<p>Graham felt strangely uneasy, and sought by
light conversation to shake off the gloom which
threatened to claim him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That thief, Mohammed,&rdquo; he said tersely,
&ldquo;has no more idea than Adam, I believe, who
your old porter friend really is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo; asked Eileen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s up in Cairo to-night, searching
for him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cornered him about it this afternoon, and
although I couldn&rsquo;t force an admission from
him&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think anybody short of an accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
K.C. could&mdash;he was suspiciously evasive!
I gave him four hours to procure the name and
address of the old gentleman to whom we owe
the price of a turquoise necklace. He has not
turned up yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eileen made no reply. Her Celtic imagination
had invested the morning&rsquo;s incident with a mystic
significance which she could not hope to impart
to her hard-headed husband.</p>

<p>A dirty and ragged Egyptian boy made his
way on to the verandah, furtively glancing about
him, as if anticipating the cuff of an unseen hand.
He sidled up to Graham, thrusting a scrap of
paper on to the little table beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; said Graham.</p>

<p>The boy nodded; and whilst Eileen watched
him interestedly, Graham, tilting the communication
so as to catch the light from the hotel
windows, read the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is come to here but cannot any farther.
I have him waiting the boy will bring you.</p>

<p class="sgn">
<span class="sign2">&ldquo;Your obedient Effendi,</span><br />
<span class="sign1">Mohammed.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Graham laughed grimly, glancing at his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only half an hour late,&rdquo; he said, standing up,
&ldquo;Wait here, Eileen; I shall not be many minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I should like to see him, too. He might
accept the price from me where you would fail
to induce him to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; said her husband; &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t
have come if he meant to refuse. What shall I
offer him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you think,&rdquo; said Eileen, smiling;
&ldquo;be generous with the poor old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graham nodded and signed to the boy that he
was ready to start.</p>

<p>The night swallowed them up; and Eileen sat
waiting, whilst the band played softly and voices
chatted incessantly around her.</p>

<p>Some five minutes elapsed; ten; fifteen. It
grew to half an hour, and she became uneasy.
She stood up and began to pace up and down the
verandah. Then the slinking figure of the Egyptian
youth reappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Graham Effendi,&rdquo; he said, showing his gleaming
teeth, &ldquo;says you come too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eileen drew her wrap more closely about her
and smiled to the boy to lead the way.</p>

<p>They passed out from the hotel, turned sharply
to the left, made in the direction of the river,
then bore off to the right in the direction of the
sand-dunes. The murmuring life of Mena House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
died into remoteness; the discordance of the Arab
village momentarily took precedence; then this,
in turn, was lost, and they were making out desert-ward
to the hollow which harbours the Sphinx.
Great events in our lives rarely leave a clear-cut
impression; often the turning-point in one&rsquo;s
career is a confused memory, a mere clash of
conflicting ideas. Trivial episodes are sharp
silhouettes; unforgettable; great happenings but
grey, vague things in life&rsquo;s panorama. Thus,
Eileen never afterwards could quite recall what
happened that night. The thing that was like
to have wrecked her life had no sharp outlines
to etch themselves upon the plate of memory.
Vaguely she wondered to what meeting-place
the boy was leading her. Faintly she was conscious
of a fear of the growing silence, of a warning
instinct whispering her to beware of the loneliness
of the desert.</p>

<p>Then the boy was gone; the silence was gone;
harsh voices were in her ears&mdash;a cloth was whipped
about her face and strong arms lifted her. She
was not of a stock that swoon or passively accept
violence. She strove to cry out, but the band
was too cunningly fastened to allow of it; she
struck out with clenched fists and not unshrewdly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
for twice her knuckles encountered a bearded
face and a suppressed exclamation told that the
blows were not those of a weakling. She kicked
furiously and drew forth a howl of pain from her
captor. Her hands flew up to the bandage,
but were roughly seized, thrust down and behind
her, and tied securely.</p>

<p>She was thrown across a saddle, and with a
thrill of horror knew herself a captive. Out
into the desert she was borne, into that unknown
land which borders so closely upon the sight-seeing
track of Cook&rsquo;s. And her helplessness,
her inability to fight, broke her spirit, born fighter
that she was; and the jarring of the saddle of
the galloping horse, the dull thud of the hoofs
on the sand, the iron grip which held her, fear,
anger, all melted into a blank.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Mohammed the dragoman, with two hotel
servants, came upon Graham some time later,
gagged and bound behind a sand hillock less than
five hundred yards from Mena House. They
had him on his feet in an instant, unbound;
and his face was ghastly&mdash;for he knew too well
what the outrage portended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; he said hoarsely. &ldquo;How long is
she gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mohammed was trembling wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly an hour, Effendi&mdash;nearly an hour.
Allah preserve us, what shall we do? I heard it
in Cairo to-night&mdash;it is all over the bazaars&mdash;the
Sheikh El-Suleym with the Masr-Bishareen
is out. They travel like the wind, Effendi. It
is not four days since they stopped a caravan
ten miles beyond Bir-Amber, now they are in
Lower Egypt. Allah preserve her!&rdquo; he ran on
volubly&mdash;&ldquo;who can overtake the horsemen of
the Bishareen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he ran on, wildly, panting as they raced
back to the hotel. The place was in an uproar.
It was an event which furnished the guests with
such a piece of local colour as none but the most
inexperienced tourist could have anticipated.</p>

<p>An Arab raid in these days of electric tramways!
A captive snatched from the very doors
of Mena House! One would as little expect an
Arab raid upon the <i>Ritz</i>!</p>

<p>The authorities at headquarters, advised of
the occurrence, found themselves at a loss how to
cope with this stupendous actuality. The desert
had extended its lean arm and snatched a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
captive to its bosom. Cairo had never before
entirely realised the potentialities of that all-embracing
desert. There are a thousand ways,
ten thousand routes, across that ruin-dotted
wilderness. Justly did the ancient people worship
in the moon the queenly Isis; for when the
silver emblem of the goddess claims the sands
for her own, to all save the desert-born they
become a place of secrets. Here is a theatre
for great dramas, wanting only the tragedian.
The outlawed Sheikh of the Bishareen knew this
full well, but, unlike others who know it, he had
acted upon his convictions and revealed to wondering
Egypt what Bedouin craft and a band of
intrepid horsemen can do, aided by a belt of
sand, and cloaked by night.</p>

<p>Graham was distracted. For he was helpless,
and realised it. Already the news was in Cairo,
and the machinery of the Government at work.
But what machinery, save that of the Omniscient,
could avail him now?</p>

<p>A crowd of visitors flocked around him, offering
frightened consolation. He broke away from
them violently&mdash;swearing&mdash;a primitive man who
wanted to be alone with his grief. The idea
uppermost in his mind was that of leaping upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
a horse and setting out in pursuit. But in which
direction should he pursue? One declared that
the Arabs must have rode this way, another that,
and yet another a third.</p>

<p>Some one shouted&mdash;the words came to him as
if through a thick curtain&mdash;that the soldiers were
coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s the good of it!&rdquo; he said,
and turned away, biting his lips.</p>

<p>When a spruce young officer came racing up
the steps to gather particulars, Graham stared
at him dully, said, &ldquo;The Arabs have got her&mdash;my
wife,&rdquo; and walked away.</p>

<p>The hoof-clatter and accompanying martial
disturbance were faint in the distance when
Mohammed ran in to where Graham was pacing
up and down in an agony of indecision&mdash;veritably
on the verge of insanity. The dragoman held a
broken gold chain in his hand, from which depended
a big turquoise that seemed to blink in the
shaded light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Effendi,&rdquo; he whispered, and held it out upon
trembling fingers, &ldquo;it is her necklet! I found it
yonder,&rdquo;&mdash;pointing eastward. &ldquo;<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Sallee &rsquo;a-nebee!</i>
it is her necklet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graham turned, gave one wild glance at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
thing, and grasped the man by the throat, glaring
madly upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dog!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;You were in the
conspiracy! It was you who sent the false
messages!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment he held him so, then dropped his
hands. Mohammed fell back, choking; but no
malice was in the velvet eyes. The Eastern
understands and respects a great passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Effendi,&rdquo; he gasped&mdash;&ldquo;I am your faithful
servant, and&mdash;I cannot write! <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Wa-llah!</i> and
by His mercy, this will save her if anything can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and ran fleetly out, Graham staring
after him.</p>

<p>It may seem singular that John Graham remained
thus inert&mdash;inactive. But upon further
consideration his attitude becomes explainable.
He knew the futility of a blind search, and dreaded
being absent if any definite clue should reach the
hotel. Meanwhile, he felt that madness was not
far off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say that they have struck out across
the Arabian Desert, Mr. Graham&mdash;probably in
the direction of the old caravan route.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graham did not turn; did not know nor care
who spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s four hundred miles across to the caravan
route,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;four hundred miles
of sand&mdash;of sand.&rdquo;</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The most simple Oriental character is full of
complexity. Mohammed the dragoman, by birth
and education a thief, by nature a sluggard, spared
no effort to reach Cairo in the shortest space of
time humanly possible. The source of his devotion
is obscure. Perhaps it was due to a humble
admiration which John Graham&rsquo;s attempt to
strangle him could not alter, or perhaps to a
motive wholly unconnected with mundane matters.
Certain it is that a sort of religious fervour
latterly had possessed the man. From being
something of a scoffer (for Islam, like other creeds,
daily loses adherents), he was become a most
devout Believer. To what this should be ascribed
I shall leave you to judge.</p>

<p>Exhausted, tottering with his giant exertions,
he made his way through the tortuous streets
of Old Cairo&mdash;streets where ancient palaces and
mansions of wealthy Turks displayed their
latticed windows, and, at that hour, barred
doors to the solitary, panting wayfarer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon one of these barred doors he beat. It
was that of an old palace which seemed to be
partially in ruins. After some delay, the door
was opened and Mohammed admitted. The door
was reclosed. And, following upon the brief
clamour, silence claimed the street again.</p>

<p>Much precious time had elapsed since Eileen
Graham&rsquo;s disappearance from the hotel by the
Pyramids, when a belated and not too sober
Greek, walking in the direction of Cairo, encountered
what his muddled senses proclaimed to
be an apparition&mdash;that of a white-robed figure
upon a snow-white camel, which sped, silent, and
with arrow-like swiftness, past him towards
Gizeh. About this vision of the racing camel
(a more beautiful creature than any he had seen
since the last to carry the Mahmal), about the
rider, spectral in the moonlight, white-bearded,
there was that which suggested a vision of the
Moslem Prophet. Ere the frightened Greek
could gather courage to turn and look after the
phantom rider, man and camel were lost across
the sands.</p>

<p>Mena House was in an uproar. No one beneath
its roof had thought of sleep that night. Futile
searches were being conducted in every direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
north, south, east, and west. Graham, feeling
that another hour of inactivity would spell
madness, had succumbed to the fever to be up
and doing, and had outdistanced all, had left the
boy far behind and was mercilessly urging his
poor little mount out into the desert, well knowing
that in all probability he was riding further
and further away from the one he sought, yet
madly pressing on. He felt that to stop was to
court certain insanity; he must press on and on;
he must search&mdash;search.</p>

<p>His mood had changed, and from cursing fate,
heaven, everything and every one, he was come
to prayer.</p>

<p>He, then, was the next to see the man on the
white camel, and, like the Greek, he scarcely
doubted that it was a wraith of his tortured
imagination. Indeed, he took it for an omen.
The Prophet had appeared to him to proclaim
that the desert, the home of Islam, had taken
Eileen from him. The white-robed figure gave
no sign, looked neither to the right nor to the
left, but straight ahead, with eagle eyes.</p>

<p>Graham pulled up his donkey, and sat like a
shape of stone, until the silver-grey distance
swallowed up the phantom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Out towards the oasis called the Well of Seven
Palms, the straggling military company proceeded
in growing weariness. The officer in charge had
secured fairly reliable evidence to show that the
Arabs had struck out straight for the Red Sea.
Since he was not omniscient, he could not know
that they had performed a wide detour which
would lead them back an hour before dawn to
the camp by the Nile beside the Temple of
Horus, where El-Suleym waited for his captive.</p>

<p>It was at the point in their march when, to have
intercepted the raiders, they should have turned
due south instead of proceeding toward the
oasis, that one of them pulled up, rubbed his
eyes, looked again and gave the alarm.</p>

<p>In another moment they all saw it&mdash;a white
camel; not such a camel as tourists are familiar
with, the poor hacks of the species, but a swan-like
creature, white as milk, bearing a white-robed
rider who ignored utterly the presence of the
soldiers, who answered by no word or sign to
their challenge, but who passed them like a cloud
borne along by a breeze and melted vaporously
into the steely distances of the desert. The captain
was hopelessly puzzled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too late to bring him down,&rdquo; he muttered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
&ldquo;and no horse that was ever born could run
down a racing camel. Most mysterious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Twenty miles south of their position, and exactly
at right-angles to their route, rode the Bishareen
horsemen, the foremost with Eileen Graham
across his saddle. And now, eighteen miles
behind the Bishareen, a white camel, of the pure
breed which yearly furnishes the stately bearer
of the Mahmal, spurned the sand and like a
creature of air gained upon the Arabs, wild riders
though they were, mile upon mile, league upon
league.</p>

<p>Within rifle-shot of the camp, and with the
desert dawn but an hour ahead, only a long sand-ridge
concealed from the eyes of the Bishareen
troupe that fleet shape which had struck wonder
to the hearts of all beholders. Despite their
start of close upon two hours, despite the fact
that the soldiers were now miles, and hopeless
miles, in their rear, the racer of the desert had
passed them!</p>

<p>Eileen Graham had returned to full and agonizing
consciousness. For hours, it seemed, her
captives had rode and rode in silence. Now a
certain coolness borne upon the breeze told her
that they were nearing the river again. Clamour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
sounded ahead. They were come to the Arab
camp. But ere they reached it they entered
some lofty building which echoed hollowly to
the horses&rsquo; tread. She was lifted from her painful
position, tied fast against a stone pillar, and the
bandage was unfastened from about her head.</p>

<p>She saw that she was lashed to one of the ruined
pillars which once had upheld the great hall of
a temple. About her were the crumbling evidences
of the sacerdotal splendour that was
Ancient Egypt. The moon painted massive
shadows upon the debris, and carpeted the outer
place with the black image of a towering propylæum.
Upon the mound which once had been
the stone avenue of approach was the Bedouin
camp. It was filled with a vague disturbance.
She was quite alone; for those who had brought
her there were leading their spent horses out to
the camp.</p>

<p>Eileen could not know what the hushed sounds
portended; but actually they were due to the
fact that the outlaw chief, wearied with that most
exhausting passion&mdash;the passion of anticipation&mdash;had
sought his tent, issuing orders that none
should disturb him. Many hours before he knew
they could return, he had stood looking out across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the sands, but at last had decided to fit himself,
by repose, for the reception of his beautiful
captive.</p>

<p>A sheikh&rsquo;s tent has two apartments&mdash;one
sacred to the lord and master, the other sheltering
his harem. To the former El-Suleym had
withdrawn; and now his emissaries stood at
the entrance, where the symbolic spear was
stuck, blade upward, in the sand. Those who
had thrown in their lot with El-Suleym, called
the Regicide, had learnt that a robber chief whose
ambitions have been whetted by a sojourn in
Europe is a hard master, though one profitable
to serve. They hesitated to arouse him, even
though their delicate task was well accomplished.</p>

<p>And whilst they debated before the tent, which
stood alone, as is usual, at some little distance
from the others, amid which moved busy figures
engaged in striking camp, Eileen, within the
temple, heard a movement behind the pillar to
which she was bound.</p>

<p>She was in no doubt respecting the identity of
her captor, and the author of the ruse by which she
had been lured from the hotel, and now, unable
to turn, it came to her that this was <em>he</em>, creeping
to her through the moon-patched shadows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
With eyes closed, and her teeth clenched convulsively,
she pictured the sinister, approaching figure.
Then, from close beside her, came a voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only I can save you from him. Do not
hesitate, do not speak. Do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eileen opened her eyes. She could not see the
speaker, but the voice was oddly familiar. Her
fevered brain told her that she had heard it before,
but speaking Arabic. It was the voice of an
old man, but a strong, vibrant voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the will of Allah, whose name be exalted,
that I repay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A lean hand held before her eyes a broken gold
chain, upon which depended a turquoise. She
knew the voice, now: it was that of the old
pedlar! But his English, except for the hoarse
Eastern accent, was flawless, and this was the
tone of no broken old man, but of one to be feared
and respected.</p>

<p>Her reason, she thought, must be tricking her.
How could the old pedlar, however strong in his
queer gratitude, save her now? Then the hand
came again before her eyes, and it held a tiny
green phial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be brave. Drink, quickly. They are coming
to take you to him. It is the only escape!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; she whispered, and turned icily
cold.</p>

<p>This was the boon he brought her. This was
the road of escape, escape from El-Suleym&mdash;the
road of death! It was cruel, unspeakably horrible,
with a bright world just opening out to
her, with youth, beauty, and&mdash;&mdash; She could
not think of her husband.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God be merciful to him!&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;But he would prefer me dead to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick! They are here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She placed her lips to the phial, and drank.</p>

<p>It seemed that fire ran through every vein in
her body. Then came chill. It grew, creeping
from her hands and her feet inward and upward
to her heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye ... dear....&rdquo; she whispered,
and sobbed once, dryly.</p>

<p>The ropes held her rigidly upright.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Wa-llah!</i> she is dead, and we have slain her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>El-Suleym&rsquo;s Bedouins stood before the pillar
in the temple, and fear was in their eyes. They
unbound the girl, beautiful yet in her marble
pallor, and lowered her rigid body to the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
They looked one at another, and many a glance
was turned toward the Nile.</p>

<p>Then the leader of the party extended a brown
hand, pointing to the tethered horses. They
passed from the temple, muttering. No one
among them dared to brave the wrath of the
terrible sheikh. As they came out into the paling
moonlight, the camp seemed to have melted
magically; for ere dawn they began their long
march to the lonely oasis in the Arabian Desert
which was the secret base of the Masr-Bishareen&rsquo;s
depredatory operations.</p>

<p>Stealthily circling the camp, which buzzed
with subdued activity&mdash;even the dogs seemed to
be silent when the sheikh slept&mdash;they came to the
horses. Solitary, a square silhouette against the
paling blue, stood the sheikh&rsquo;s tent, on top of
the mound, which alone was still untouched.</p>

<p>The first horseman had actually leapt into the
saddle, and the others, with furtive glances at
the ominous hillock, were about to do likewise,
when a low wail, weird, eerie, rose above the
muffled stirring of the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Allah el-&rsquo;Azeen!</i>&rdquo; groaned one of the party&mdash;&ldquo;what
is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the wail sounded&mdash;and again. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
woman voices took it up. It electrified the whole
camp. Escape, undetected, was no longer possible.
Men, women, and children were abandoning
their tasks and standing, petrified with the
awe of it, and looking towards the sheikh&rsquo;s tent.</p>

<p>As they looked, as the frightened fugitives
hesitated, looking also, from the tent issued
forth a melancholy procession. It was composed
of the women of El-Suleym&rsquo;s household. They beat
their bared breasts and cast dust upon their heads.</p>

<p>For within his own sacred apartment lay the
sheikh in his blood&mdash;a headless corpse.</p>

<p>And now those who had trembled before him
were hot to avenge him. Riders plunged out
in directions as diverse as the spokes of a wheel.
Four of them rode madly through the temple
where they had left the body of their captive,
leaping the debris, and circling about the towering
pillars, as only Arab horsemen can. Out into
the sands they swept; and before them, from
out of a hollow, rose an apparition that brought
all four up short, their steeds upreared upon
their haunches.</p>

<p>It was the figure of a white-bearded man, white-robed
and wearing the green turban, mounted upon
a camel which, to the eyes of the four, looked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
its spotless whiteness a creature of another
world. Before the eagle-eyed stranger lay the
still form of Eileen Graham, and as the camel
rose to its feet, its rider turned, swung something
high above him, and hurled it back at the panic-stricken
pursuers. Right amongst their horses&rsquo;
feet it rolled, and up at them in the moonlight
from out a mass of blood-clotted beard, stared
the glassy eyes of El-Suleym!</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when the grey-faced
and haggard-eyed searchers came straggling
back to Mena House. Two of them, who had
come upon Graham ten miles to the east, brought
him in. He was quite passive, and offered no
protest, spoke no word, but stared straight in front
of him with a set smile that was dreadful to see.</p>

<p>No news had come from the company of soldiers;
no news had come from anywhere. It
was ghastly, inconceivable; people looked at
one another and asked if it could really be possible
that one of their number had been snatched out
from their midst in such fashion.</p>

<p>Officials, military and civil, literally in crowds,
besieged the hotel. Amid that scene of confusion
no one missed Mohammed; but when all
the rest had given up in despair, he, a solitary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
patient figure, stood out upon a distant mound
watching the desert road to the east. He alone
saw the return of the white camel with its double
burden, from a distance of a hundred yards or
more; for he dared approach no closer, but
stood with bowed head pronouncing the <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">fáthah</i>
over and over again. He saw it kneel, saw its
rider descend and lift a girl from its back. He saw
him force something between her lips, saw him
turn and make a deep obeisance toward Mecca.
At that he, too, knelt and did likewise. When
he arose, camel and rider were gone.</p>

<p>He raced across the sands as Eileen Graham
opened her eyes, and supported her as she struggled
to her feet, pale and trembling.</p>

<p class="ast">*****</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it at all,&rdquo; said Graham.</p>

<p>Eileen smiled up at him from the long cane
chair. She was not yet recovered from her
dreadful experience. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said softly,
&ldquo;you will not laugh in future at my Irish stories
of the &lsquo;good people&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graham shook his head and turned to Mohammed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean, Mohammed?&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Thank God it means that I have got her back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
but how was it done? She returned wearing the
turquoise necklace, which I last saw in your hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mohammed looked aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took it to him, Effendi. It was the token
by which he knew her need.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pedlar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pedlar, Effendi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You knew where to find him, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew where to find him, but I feared to
tell you; feared that you might ridicule him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ceased. He was become oddly reticent.
Graham shrugged his shoulders, helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope the authorities will succeed in
capturing the Bishareen brigands,&rdquo; he said grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The authorities will never capture them,&rdquo;
replied the dragoman with conviction. &ldquo;For
five years they have lived by plunder, and laughed
at the Government. But before another moon is
risen&rdquo;&mdash;he was warming to his usual eloquence now&mdash;&ldquo;no
Masr-Bishareen will remain in the land, they
will be exterminated&mdash;purged from the desert!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Graham; &ldquo;by whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the Rawallah, Effendi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they a Bedouin tribe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The greatest of them all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why should they undertake the duty?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is the will of the one who saved
her for you, Effendi! I am blessed that I have
set eyes upon him, spoken with him. Paradise
is assured to me because my hand returned to
him his turban when it lay in the dust!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graham stared, looking from his wife, who lay
back smiling dreamily, to Mohammed, whose dark
eyes burnt with a strange fervour&mdash;the fervour
of one mysteriously converted to an almost
fanatic faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you speaking of our old friend, the pedlar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am almost afraid to speak of him, Effendi,
for he is the chosen of heaven, a cleanser of
uncleanliness; the scourge of God, who holds
His flail in his hand&mdash;the broom of the desert!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Graham, who had been pacing up and down the
room, paused in front of Mohammed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he, then?&rdquo; he asked quietly. &ldquo;I
owe him a debt I can never hope to repay, so I
should at least like to know his real name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost fear to speak it, Effendi.&rdquo; Mohammed&rsquo;s
voice sank to a whisper, and he raised
the turquoise hanging by the thin chain about
Eileen&rsquo;s throat, and reverently touched it with
his lips. &ldquo;He is the <i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">welee</i>&mdash;Ben Azreem, Sheikh
of the Ibn-Rawallah!&rdquo;</p>
